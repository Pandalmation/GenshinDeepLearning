I don't have a 5star character all I've got are 4star character so it is suck to be a f2p unless you save a lot or primogems. One good thing about it is you don't need a 5 star character to beat and enjoy the game though I do need the mc though, as she can upgrade her constellations with just lvling up rank or the story progress. Yeah it is hard to earn primogems I guess I better sucked it up.",5,2023-08-22 13:15:34,4.0.0_16983586_17100363

The characters, elemental system, and overworld are so detailed. The controls and camera can be improved, definitely, but they aren't game breaking. Just inconvenient sometimes. Also, some of the voice lines compared to the captions are entirely different from each other which kind of breaks immersion.

Also very difficult to make precise movements and trying to pick up stuff while running takes some practice for sure. Other than the touchscreen controls I'm very impressed.

Fun to explore world with various puzzles; 2. Decent story; 3. Regular various events. Note: due to the big differences in event gameplay mechanics some may be to your liking and some may not, but considering overall variety it will still be a positive thing; 4. Smooth combat (albeit lacking some necessary UI elements). Cons: 1. Daily routine becomes too repetitive and boring after finishing world exploration; 2. Character progression is horrible with excessive RNG elements where it shouldn't be in the first place (looking at you artifact domains); 3.

Some might argue that this is false because there's so many nations/locations; before I would've agreed but after playing this game for more than a year, I disagree. My reasoning for it is because exploring Teyvat isn't that hard. Teyvat is very easy to explore + the map is also really easy to understand which makes exploring really easy. Other than that, the characters are all designed well. Reward system is very flawed in my opinion, it takes a long time to actually get Primogems (Game Currency) once you're an end game player which would sometimes brainwash you into pretty much acting as if the Daily Commission is a chore.

The combat feels incredibly fluid, and works pretty damn well on a touchscreen, the graphics are really pretty and definitely pushing what phones can display, the movement (albeit a little flawed) feels more than good enough and the open world works well. The music is great, but the implementation needs work. The open world is a bit closed off, which I don't love.",4,2020-09-29 06:09:26,1.0.0_1112729_1135452

An example is when I try to aim at something but moving the screen around to adjust the aim at the enemy feels very heavy sometimes. It feels like it's buggy/laggy so I can't aim properly.

The characters are generally well thought out and fun to discover. Where things get hard is once you actually play the game: the controls are absolutely horrible and controller support is nowhere in sight (iOS has had this for nearly a year now but some of the workarounds people have come up with on Android have led to users being banned leaving you to contend with very underwhelming touchscreen controls). You will also find yourself fighting the engine much more than the enemies, there are a number of ways the game becomes anti-immersive, from the constant zooming-in depending on your combat actions (there should simply be a way to turn off auto zoom off but this illudes the devs completely) to enemies walking off a preset area mid-fight where they will walk back to their spawn point and regen 100% HP and have you start the fight over (something to drive you insane when fighting new and more powerfull foes).

The game is exceptionally well made for a phone game except for lip syncing which is atrocious. The monetization is very heavy handed with almost every scheme in display (gacha, battle pass, xp, etc.). While it is possible to finish the game without spending money, the mtx makes your life a heck of a lot easier with less grinding.",3,2021-06-13 21:53:03,
8e96630b-28be-43e7-a73b-60f784af2542,"Hate that you can't skip the storyline so you're stuck reading dialogue that I'm not interested in. Can't collect items or chests my friends world and have it count in my world. Makes exploring and having fun with friends boring because I have to collect the items again in my world. Most other games have this availability. There's so much I can't do in co-op mode like events or quests, which makes it boring.",1,2023-11-15 23:10:01,
299874b9-c5b6-4b80-94d7-1119a80b6562,Great game so far which I'd say easily surpasses most mobile games I've played. The controls on a mobile screen are sometimes hard to work with but it's great that you can play this game on a pc as well to help mitigate that. Voice acting is decent and i love that I can choose a different language for the audio vs subtitles. Highly recommended but also very addicting so beware!,5,2020-10-16 13:14:03,1.0.0_1112729_1135452
1020e858-0c5a-4fcc-95a1-8c554ee7e1f0,"Controls, Gameplay, and Graphics are all 5 stars but I'm only rating it 4 stars because of the systems that are unoptimized. They have to fix their resin system, and the way that you can only progress with resin. They have to add more ways to spend our time in the endgame because it's only a 15 minute playtime once you get to the higher level. In short more content and better systems",5,2022-03-30 12:39:50,
