I don't have a 5star character all I've got are 4star character so it is suck to be a f2p unless you save a lot or primogems. One good thing about it is you don't need a 5 star character to beat and enjoy the game though I do need the mc though, as she can upgrade her constellations with just lvling up rank or the story progress. Yeah it is hard to earn primogems I guess I better sucked it up.",5,2023-08-22 13:15:34,4.0.0_16983586_17100363

I wonder if others do too? •Liyue - another grand adventure! I met some of my favourite characters here that I adore still years on. •Inazuma - It's urple •Sumeru - A great story with wonderful lore and fantastic characters. You can also begin to really see how much their character models have improved over the years! •Fontaine - Its cool!

And as people say the game gets bigger and bigger and some people just don't have 25-35 giga bites of space. Visuals are awesome but every couple hours you will crash.

The controls are a little harder on mobile as opposed to PC (I play both) but that's on account of my own dexterity. Everything is easy to pick up and learn, and the open world is gorgeous. I love climbing mountains and just staring at scenery. After almost half a year, the end game is repetitive and there's not much to do. You can still appreciate the wonderful scenery and the amazing music",4,2021-03-11 20:51:42,1.3.0_1825294_1872772

Also very difficult to make precise movements and trying to pick up stuff while running takes some practice for sure. Other than the touchscreen controls I'm very impressed. You can tell this game was developed more for console gaming and then adapted for phones. The slight frustration of the controls is worth getting to play it though.,4,2021-03-16 12:44:08,1.3.0_1825294_1872772

Fun to explore world with various puzzles; 2. Decent story; 3. Regular various events. Note: due to the big differences in event gameplay mechanics some may be to your liking and some may not, but considering overall variety it will still be a positive thing; 4. Smooth combat (albeit lacking some necessary UI elements). Cons: 1. Daily routine becomes too repetitive and boring after finishing world exploration; 2. Character progression is horrible with excessive RNG elements where it shouldn't be in the first place (looking at you artifact domains); 3. Developers feedback is lacking and issues that have been bothering players since day 1 are still unaddressed.

It is an RPG so we get to level up our characters through work, which I find very entertaining. The design is incredible and so is the music. I reccommend this game to everyone.

Sadly, the resin lock makes artifacts too hard to farm, and it's even more frustrating that they are so random. It's hard to level up all the characters you want as well.

As a late game player there are very limited ways to get primogems other than buying them. In addition to this since there are very little new quests there are about 30 minutes of content every day.

Some might argue that this is false because there's so many nations/locations; before I would've agreed but after playing this game for more than a year, I disagree. My reasoning for it is because exploring Teyvat isn't that hard. Teyvat is very easy to explore + the map is also really easy to understand which makes exploring really easy. Other than that, the characters are all designed well. Reward system is very flawed in my opinion, it takes a long time to actually get Primogems (Game Currency) once you're an end game player which would sometimes brainwash you into pretty much acting as if the Daily Commission is a chore. Story/Lore-wise however, is really good! I love the lore and it's very engaging!

It looks great and i haven't experienced many glitches besides some movement issues after playing a few hours. But you can't expect much from a game with touch screen mechanics. overall i give the game a 8.8 out of 10 consideringits free. my oppion may change later.,4,2020-10-04 14:58:58,1.0.0_1112729_1135452

If you easily get addicted to these types of games and feel like you have to collect everything, you might want to stay away from this game because you can easily spend a LOT of money.",5,2021-04-10 18:44:55,1.4.1_2154667_2147343

The world is full of stuff todo and explore. But there is something that is also part of the PlayStation port. The performance is the worst. I'm playing on a galaxy 8+ which should be capable but unfortunately not. The PlayStation as well. On my PC tho it runs smoothly and looks awesome.

Elemental reactions, lots of gear to boost different status, changing between 4 characters on the fly to come up with some crazy tactics, amazing and enticing story line with interesting characters. The pity system ensures you can always get new characters even if you're just a F2P player. You can get away with also only investing around 30 minutes a day in the game if you're a busy person and get all the most crucial stuff done.

e4de10e3-e0ba-4dab-95df-873b0d0cd900,Everything seems good but I still have issues with using the bow in mobile. Sometimes the sensitivity when aiming is not what it seems. An example is when I try to aim at something but moving the screen around to adjust the aim at the enemy feels very heavy sometimes. It feels like it's buggy/laggy so I can't aim properly. My ping is usually green and sometimes yellow. I know about the new features added in the settings for bows to help in aiming but it still doesn't help with my problem.,4,2021-05-01 16:45:08,1.5.0_2574575_2578841

Hello devs, I have a suggestion, it would be nice if we can swiftly change our party 1 to party 2 with the click of a button, long pressing the portrait allows to quickly configure the party setup, but what if there's a button to switch between party 1 and party 2, without needing to configure the current setup and switch between characters that is necessary in certain situations.

The multiple changes we keep asking for can be found in star rail while Genshin still doesn't have them (more resins, endgames, substats change, etc) and the lack of communication from the developers is concerning.

Also, idk why is it sort of clunky to aim with archers,like sometimes I can't move them to 'aim' at my target, or it just moves so slow and very little; but it could be just a problem for phone?

You can also co op with your friends to complete quests and missions. I highly recommend this game but it does require a large data storage.
