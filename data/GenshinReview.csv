1,for whatever reason my game used to work just fine except for cutscenes when it crashed and would not play so i had to use geforce but now it just refuses to open it opens up shows a black screen and promptly crashes again i have tried uninstalling and reinstalling took about three hours by the way and restarting my device it just does not work fun game though
1,i do like this game but there is seriously things they need to fix mostly either being able to skip dialogue or pause stuff as i have been continuing the archon quest from the current update and it is been on for over minute without being able to stop it because if you do you need to redo everything if they could at least warn people on how long it is before you can stop but no of course not they need to fix this not everyone wants has time to go through with everything straight away
1,downloaded it once and it worked downloaded it again and now it says insufficient space every single time even though i have plenty of space i have deleted apps removed pictures and i have done everything i could to try to make it work delete and redownload restart phone clear cache and data clear cache and data for my playstore everything disappointing as hell i cannot play
1,my data is mbps when i open this game the ms speed is normal but when i do daily or run a mission his ping turns red and his ms is every time i meet an enemy something like that must happen when not fighting ms is normal but when you meet the enemy ms lag all the time waste a lot of money and feel like a loss when something like this happens sorry my english is bad i have been playing this game since it was released it is really disappointing
1,i have not played the game because of some problems when the game is done downloading and i try to play it it says i have infuscent space when that stops it starts loading but it never finish the process please fix it
1,i used to love this game but now i am quite disappointed in wishing system there is no guarantee that you will get the five star character which you are aiming for even if you use wishes it is one of the reason now that i have stopped playing this game although graphics and storyline is great but wishing system nah highly disappointed not gonna play this game anymore one star is enough
1,resin per day is an atrocious idea that and the fact certain characters get powercrept so bad with each new region characters should be complete at constellationand their constellations should serve only as optional qol improvements and yet hoyoverse is so greedy for the dollar that characters are now expected to be decent at constellationand their full potential is locked in constellations not to mention the lack of a skip button a gigabyte open world game lacks a skip button guys amazing
1,the looks cool and i would really like to play it but in the state it is in now i would have to delete my system files to have it run on my device if the bulky files could download to the sd card then it would run fine but as it is only the games smallest files will download to my sd card while the others will only download to my internal storage
1,my phone stops working every time i try too play the game normally it happens often in fontaine can you please fix this no matter what i do i can never play the game i lost two of my account because of this whether i uninstall the game and re install it it does not work i have too keep on restarting my phone and it does not work either i am not even in the highest graphics i am at the lowest
1,do not bother playing on mobile this is a pc console game it is been frustrating deleting a bunch of my stuff just to try and fit the size requirements of this game only to fail everytime stick to console or pc mobile controls are not great anyways and there is no controller support it is a great game otherwise but the mobile support is abysmal
1,been trying to update and redownload the game several times and i have even tried getting rid of other apps and photos and stuff yet it keeps telling me i have insufficient storage when it starts the download after i log in loved playing it but can no longer continue thanks to whatever is blocking me from playing
1,the game just getting worst and lots of bugs because the bug still do not fix in lonely place where my screen turn black and crash and also i cannot complete archon quest now because the mission there is just black screen i try reopening the game and nothing is showing on the screen another problem when i use kaeya with her freeze skill in water there is no ice showing in the water i tried reporting this bug in feedback in the game i am still waiting for update
1,stupid app do not you know how long i waited to download the download of the update started all over again when it reached gigabyte in size and i had to keep hitting retry when a notification popped up check connection while downloading it even though my internet connection was fine stupid app i retired today after playing from version had enough of it
1,gigabytes download file optimization and shaders optimization took forever only to only get stuck in a story i could not skip and choose either male or female children characters with no customization then cause i left the stupid fairy to go directly to my destination instead of the long way it wanted me to go all the way back to follow it uninstalled it
1,from what i could see just the main menu the game looked decent but i cannot play the game because it says i have insignificant storage so i deleted everything my phone now has nothing but the playstore and genshin no photos either i am very disappointed and will not be trying to download play it again
1,downloaded the game last night went to play it after work to find it had to download an update five hours later and the update is at no reason whatsoever any mobile game should take five hours plus before it can be played expecially on the newest model phone with cell service and internet connection have not even played the game and already annoyed with it
1,why would anybody continue to play this when you get thrown away from every little twig that gets thrown at you but do it to enemies and they still hitting you like nothin happens to them no skip dialogue glitches that make the enemies not lose their shield glitches that keep you falling in place the pulls in the shop are so bad saying it is chance but spend like one hundred fate things and most of them only gave me one character over and over again do they care to actually make it that no
1,i really love this game but i deleted it few months ago because it was to laggy and now i downloaded it again it took me ten hours to download everything and then it will not even let me play everytime i restarted the game and when its in the loading screen when the geo part is almost done the game automatically log out
1,i tried downloading the app on chromebook and it crashes whenever it tries to download shaders i looked through other reviews and hoyoverse says things like talk to in game customer support but i cannot get to in game customer support because the game crashes when i try to download it great game played on ps bulky app and it will collect dust until i get a pc which will probably never happen sucks for hoyo too because i would buy primo if it downloaded
1,sigh after two years playing a game with a stunning graphics great story and lore unique combat mechanic building many characters so it will be stronger i am now devastated by hoyoverse statement to not give an end game content just because it will give anxiety to casual players what a stupid statement i planned to quit the game if hoyoverse do not want to change plan after patch end after all i am pretty finished building all element characters and only comeback if hoyoverse hear us
1,a decent game but we have way too much dialogue that cannot be skipped missions that seems that i am an employee for this game where i spend hours to earn some meaningless reward and it gets boring with same enemies quest while story it is all over the place although i am a day one player i had no option but to quit because game was more draining than rewarding
1,i downloaded the game from play store because it looked amazing however after connecting my facebook gmail it kept saying insufficient storage available i removed over gigabyte on my phone i uninstalled reinstalled and even after all of this it still says the same thing my phone is a samsung fe with one terabyte of storage so maybe you folks might need an update or send me a manual of how i am doing this wrong i will update when this gets resolved until then i am uninstalling
1,since i have downloaded the fontaine map it keeps on glitching and then shut off the apps on itself then i will have to reload the game all over again it happened multiple times consecutively that i am just sick of it and decided not to play the game for weeks now when i start the game the problem is still happening hoyoverse please fix this i legit cannot play this game if it keeps on shutting down on itself i will change my rating if you fix this issue thank you
1,when i play this game even if its on low graphics my phone still heats up and it freezes my phone for a while and i have to leave it in the freezer for minutes for it to cool down it also takes up over of my storage which is really bad i cannot even change the settings because i know my phone will freeze its such a trash app because the only things good about the updates are the new characters and that is it instead of new charcters you should make the graphics look better wang ban dun bui zui
1,re downloaded after a year or so percent of the new content is basically a visual novel of very slow dialogue and is super boring it completely overshadows the other gameplay mechanics will not come back until there is an option to drastically decrease the time wasted in watching the characters talk with each other
1,the game gets much too hard and makes it basically impossible for casual gamers to make it to inazuma i could not get past this one damn quest and now i am stuck there is no difficulty slider because this is a pay to win game you can only lower your world level one after you get up past the world level that i am currently at so i would just be at the same level that i am currently at i have basically had to quit the game because it is so aggravatingly difficult to play
1,characters designs and stories are well made but the main overall plot is non existent adventurer rank begins the miserable abyss and artifact gearing grind which ruins the game expensive gacha terrible rates do not chase gacha caution and do not spend any money on this game to enjoy it second anniversary event was moving settings sliders devs will never fix any problems ex notifications still broken after two years no android controller support quitting the game has been the best
1,no controller support cannot remove on screen buttons mobile exprience is not good pc version is worst cannot customize controls either they keep making the game boring i am back after a long time so there is a lot to explore but the events are still as boring as ever they need to hire better game designers
1,it is a really good would recommend to a lot of people but it takes up too much storage so i cannot play no more it would be a five star if you could make their a better chance to have more character and to get more animal characters thank you for listening but please it takes up too much storage i deleted every single app on my phone but it will not work
1,a number of issues have built up over time but the worst for me has been the gameplay and damage output issues with new characters especially dehya i am also disappointed we still do not have a resin cap or regeneration increase despite so many new bosses this has all been met with radio silence by the devs i am still enjoying the game but they get a star until they actually listen to player feedback
1,i reach out to customer service and they said that my phone is not compatible to install this game i just bought this phone this year and when i initially install the game works well after few weeks the game crash and got error saying system user interface is not responding tried to do basic trouble shooting but nothing works then when i check google play store it says on compatibility that it works on your device so i re installed it but fater couple of days it carsh again with the same error
1,it has been years since the release of the game and yet no controller support is given to android users showing favoritism in devices are an eyesore the storyline gets boring once you progress and you are forced to eat all the dialogues that are so long each dialogue only contains an important detail but the rest is bull overall the gacha system makes it a bearable game but with all the negative factors given it is not a game recommended for those who dislike faulty controls
1,really great game but i just recently spent dollars on a controller just to find out that there is no controller support for android like come on not funny other than that the graphics are really great and i love the story but if you could just add controller support for android i will put five stars and tell all my friends to play your games but right now i will play games that actually do have controller support for all devices but only because i cannot the touch screen much for reasons
1,this game was enjoyable when it originally came out as was the subsequent updates however because there is no skip option or alternatives it is tough to keep up with the storylines i know you work hard to create plot lines for genshin but some individuals simply do not have the time to keep up
1,uninstalled cos its a rip off if you want to level up real good you have to pay money even leveling up your character still is not good enough the stories are boring asf and take too long to skip too many mission all at once plus side games cannot keep up with play not enough rewards to level up or you have to be a certain level to fight for rewards to level up characters
1,the game is good and all but the artifact system is super unfair i have been farming a domain for a certain character for over a year and i have not gotten a piece that fits well with my character the weapon banner is a huge scam and should not reset everyime this is the worst game it is super unfair and i am so unlucky for what we also need more resin
1,it is the only reason mobile action games do not have controller support is either developer lazyness or ineptitude despite claiming this app is in version it does not have even basic functionality expected of it is genre unplayable on mobile update years out and still no controller support this is basic functionality in unity dropping to one star
1,love this game great free zelda botw clone unfortunately my phone is not beefy enough to run but been playing on ps and it is amazing edit so years after this officially released on android we still have no controller support luckily i have the redmagic six pro gaming phone that has its own special controller similar to joycons that has remapping functions currently cannot find it and it is absolutely ridiculous our complaints are ignored star until it is fixed
1,for some reason the sprint and jump button cannot be moved they are where the attack buttons should be so you keep jumping and sprinting rather than attacking not sure why the buttons cannot be moved the interface sucks it is like the developers want you to stop playing for some reason
1,rng is so fckng awful high demand low return hard pity artifact roll artifact drop the substats for three years the qol requests that are not fulfilled but was instead put on the other game lmao i love the lore i love the characters but playing is not rewarding and the rng does not help just makes me feel shit i do not feel like spending anymore cause it does not feel rewarding besides aside from the free items from codes which feels like scraps lol the new characters have shitty skillset
1,we need skip button a lot of people already sent their complaint about this but no response we need skip button not because we want to skip stories think of it how about the people who changed servers that already know the flow of story archon quest but we do not have a choice but to click faster just to finish the dialogue lmao
1,this game was very good the storyline the graphics everything but after a few updates you cannot play on your phone every time i try it just glitch and close itself i have already set all the settings to low but you just cannot play anymore on the phone
1,still no controller support for three years but iphone already have why you cannot put it also to android device if you have already features on the other brand and also no skip features it takes a lot of time just to finish the dialogues but the gameplay takes shortly i do not want to do this to make your game bad but simple features for most few people wants that is they want to have geez keymapper apps gives also temp and banned the user still one star for features four star as good game
1,great game with new concepts and events upgrading constellations of five star characters as well as getting and refining five star weapons are mostly impossible for any free to playplayer apart from that in game primo available through events are really less in quantity considering the number of wishes you have to make to get five star characters and items also the resin refil is too slow and cap on it really sucks
1,it was great but everything feels like a chore now very long and boring dialogues in sumeru tcg which absolutely has nothing to do with open world rpg it was all unnecessary but you have to play through them or else you will not get the resources you will need edit everything is great again with fontaine but sumeru definitely left a bad aftertaste not going to change my rating because of that
1,very poor experience so far first it has to install the game from the play store and then just when you think you are ready to start playing it is got to download yet another package and after that ones downloaded it has to verify another package and this keeps going endlessly is this a goddamn music app or a game too bad they ripped off the theme from the titanic music
1,the games fun i will leave it at that i have no problem other than the lack of proper gamepad support but fix your goddamn optimization the thing almost brick my three days brand new phone when i fill your goddamn survey just because a whatsapp massage got in this incompetent truly left a rotten taste on my mouth for otherwise stellar game review
1,if you are on a chromebook do not install this it was really smooth until the sumeru update now there are various glitches if i play as a female character it crashes or acts like i walked out of the map if it is raining and i fight it crashes if i sit down i sink below the map and most of the characters details do not load for me faceless just shadows one coloured clothes ect since fontaine it is been hard to even enter the game i usually have to try around six times before i get in
1,it is trash i cannot even play with a controller this game does not even have access to fps and it is supposed to be a really good game well i think not it is so bad that it keeps lagging like crazy even on high end devices you need to have the fastest internet in the world for it to barely stay on ms as if it could not get worse fps controller are only and i mean only supported on ios as if it could not have gotten worse fix your game mihoyo it is trash and i mean favouritism
1,lots of boring dialogues that we cannot skip it is frustrating to start a random world quest or dialogue with npc characters and not be able to skip the dialogue currently honkai sr keeps you more involved in the story as they use slang and perfectly adapt the game to the region in my case brazil
1,fresh player of genshin impact on mobile i have been dedicated to the game investing time and effort to boost my account with a star character after completing a pull on the banner i was disappointed to find that i still had not obtained a star character i understand luck plays a role but this experience left me feeling overlooked and disheartened progressing in the game without such characters has become a daunting task especially as the monsters levels increase
1,i am going to talk about artifacts first they are rigged second i have been farming for a good set for months and i have yet to get one resin powers everything you do in the game yet we get so little of it either raise the cap or decrease regen time also make rates for artifacts less rigged add a mechanic where you can change the stats by using other farmable materials like honkai star rail change the domains so we do not have to get a piece from the set we are not farming having two sets in one is so bad
1,i love the game but like lol i know you have probably heard the same complaints before but skirks design is basic and lame i like suggestive designs too but that design did you draw that w your left hand maybe its horrendous all that anticipation just to give her a piece of fabric for clothes i thought it was a joke when i saw her the first time are you all trying to turn genshin into honkai my problem is not that its sexy my problem is that it looks random and nothing special
1,been playing for two years on medium on my chromebook updated from android nine to performance took a huge hit and black boxes appeared around foliage completely unplayable had literally played before updating it was still where i left it contacted support suddenly they are telling me my device must be too low spec when the game got zero updates when i upgraded android version and my review here keeps disappearing for some reason
1,edited i play like for two days and after the next update it is already massive amount of storage and in the end i cannot play it at all i ended up delete it back after downloading amount of resources it is sad and i also cannot use the genshin cloud because mine is connected with facebook and there is no facebook option
1,the app has the option to delete finished quest but they will be reinstalled if you open the game again there is no way to choose the other voice over language unless you can access the game which is already impossible for me this game is still too big for my tablet no matter how many files i deleted just for this game better try other games
1,my rating used to be five stars but i am returning to the game after a while and i log into the same account and server as before and all my progress is lost i tried to search up a solution and got no help from the support team the only fix they gave me is for pc and it requires a third party app to access lost files and it is not compatible with mobile i am gonna delete and if you have the same problem i suggest you do the same the tech support for this app is a joke if i could i would give zero stars
1,this game needs to put out there publicly that the mobile version takes almost gigabyte right off the bat it may delete a lot of that after the initial install but if you do not have dollar to spend on a gigabyte phone do not install this on it i have a gigabyte phone and have gigabyte of un ueed space and i still cannot download this mobile game since when tf does any game on mobile take gigabyte fix your initial download size and maybe you will have a player base again i do play on console and like that
1,add controller gamepad support for android ios has it very bad experience so many updates but not addinga good experience feature wasted gigabyte for this low quality content uninstalling it when you add gamepad support will think overit again
1,very good game lore aspect good graphics aesthetics great open world but there is no way to get resin unless it is paid without resin only archon quest can be considered as content and once it over back to being dailies and log out and do you know how many days of resin it took to get a character to a good stat and level expecting good change is a disappointment if you want good experience just play star rail changed to one star because of terrible cs team
1,some quests are impossible to complete they are simply too difficult like the raiden training quest for me it is impossible there is no skip quest button no way to continue in the main archon quest it takes too much skill and timing that i am incapable of so i cannot play anymore there is no way forward from this quest nothing to do here but quit the game
1,now a days game getting worse story are getting bigger story conversation taking more time that playing puzle game is getting lesser so ther no much interest now a days all time is getting wested listing the story open world enemies need to be more tough to play it should not take long time to defeat instead they should do more numbers damage
1,great graphics fun game but play on windows playstation or even ios for controller support and still no controller support the android version is a last class citizen edit i have already been providing feedback on controller support for years update still no controller support
1,it was great until it deleted all my progress on my account it did not happend to just me a lot of people have the same account same i would blah blah but there progress got back to zero please fix this hoyoverse because people spend blood sweat and tears into this game all three of my account were either reseted or cannot access despite making sure its the rigth password
1,it is a good game overall but they made it to where my new phone which is a newer type of phone was not able to get the resource packs to even play the game i uninstalled eight apps and its still not good enough and they were giant games including my email
1,fun at first but even in your first game you will be burn out from it the game is just too much from a open world game the reward is not benefitting for the hard work you put in the game a challenge that only give two primo a slow long seelie chase that only give two primo for a primo per wish even gifting is not even very good everything is all about contest to earn in game money with winners of the b millions of players character design is so so everything is rng
1,am frustrated about the artifact system of this game did more then one hundred domain just to get all def artifact what a joke feel like killing my self hope you guys fix it i like the overall game but only because of the artifact system this game gets solid of ot other then the artifact probably it gets a solid not to mention the spiral abyss is too hard for a free to playplayer like me please remove the timer option in abyss it is so unfair those pay to win players kill one hundred lev boss with one short
1,the smart way of sapping money from children is by locking suitable characters to progress through the game behind either a paywall or leaving it to chance is what this game is about the game makes it near to impossible to earn a good amount of tokens to wish and the chance of getting the character is ridiculous and that makes people want to spend real money in order to get their favorite character before its gone for a while the game later on requires you to havea five star character to progess
1,no controller support on android the game is amazing story quests characters all are great but just not on android i will gladly change this to five stars when controllers are recognized in game on android without using third party apps
1,what is wrong with this game i thought i closed the app but i did not know that the game was downloading recourses in the backgorund it used my all gigabyte of mobile data and my battery was when i opened my phone the game sends notifications silently so i could not notice i think it should ask for downloading recourses in the background i hope you will not ignore this
1,my genshin is laggy even though i have so much storage after i updated my software on my phone two times and seahorse boss entrance made my genshin freeze and make my whole phone crash after a few tries it is even worse when it loading at the elements screen it crashed hoyoverse please help me
1,i have been playing since launch but they hardly improved anything having to wait three years for a quick gadget change option is just wow a skip button still not existing in the game since launch these should be basic things i think not a three year improvement plan just goes to show the mentality of what is important cannot play more than minute daily there is nothing to do at least for people who play for a long time such a shame the game could be so much better goodbye genshin impact
1,why do not you listen why do not you solve the problem one star now there is keybinding option but the game does not support gamepad why this game is good so it should support gamepad too i want to use my gamepads on it but it does not show gamepad option please fix it add gamepads support please
1,to the devs you have made a great game great story amazing audio and phenomenal characters to the corporates i understand it is a business but you are being too stingy with the rewards and tiring aspects like rng artificact farming
1,this new update is so annoying my game keeps crashing everytime i do the new archon quest i keep having to repeat the story again and again and it sucks just because my game keeps reconnecting i do not know if it is because of my server asia but come on let me finish the archon quest bruh
1,i have been playing this game for more that a year but recently the game keeps crashing minutes in the game i have looked up about this issue and many players are experiencing the same problem please fix this problem
1,i have played this game for a while now and although it is not perfect i have enjoyed this game and even spent money on it however the main character the traveler my favorite character in the game has been treated poorly especially with the release of fontaine the hydro element they got was the last straw for me with how it functions and until they fix it i am not spending a dime
1,i would love to be able to give a review but i have not even been able to register much less play i enter my email and pick a password but all that info is gone when i come back from getting the code from my email and the seconds i have left just is not enough time for me to reenter all that info i am sure i would enjoy this game it is right up my alley but i am frustrated before even playing and that is not a good sign of what is to come
1,this game is very fun and the open world and music are amazing however the artifact system has too much rng and they rarely add quality of life changes to make the experience better edit here is chance of me giving you a five star
1,if you play you will be constantly contacting the customer service to have them fix your ping if you are enjoying a ms ping daily once a new update is nearing its release date they will segregate your account and your ping will become worst and will climb up to ms ping yellow and it will permanently remain in there unless you contact the customer service to have you rerouted and get it fixed this has been an issue for three years the devs are incompetent and they do not improve their server
1,amazing open world design with complex combat system although the game is filled with too much rng and currently the game is very predatory with its monetization combined with very stingy developer team
1,when i do not play it for a while i cannot play it unless i uninstall and reinstall the game always getting an error unsuffient storage i still have lots of storage left though it is taking to eight hours to download this game brcause its gigabyte
1,hoyoverse did not try to reduce size games and decided making clound stream witch is too much queue and not optimized at all devs did not care about new content for end game player everyday login game just feel boring and its still at and already gigabyte size did not makes sense at all first anniversary till now the rewards still not much and useless reward if this still going i afraid genshin will be dead game as soon as possible
1,unable to download the content but there is no reason why a game for a mobile devile should need that much storage space the game is saying it needs mg that is giga unreal i have been in apps development for years and never have i even used up giga on a pc for any application
1,when my game fully loads in at the loading screen with elements when the geo symbol fully liads in my game freezes and the geo symbol loads backwards when it does that my game crashes i tried installing and re installing the app buf it still does not work my phone has enough storage so i do not really understand why it crashes like that please fix it
1,seems great but no controller support i am confused why there is an option for changing control type when it is not actually implemented on android it is a bit rude i am done with these developers and the gambling implementation my country has a huge problem with gambling gacha is heavily sanctioned and more convenient than gambling has ever been not helping please do not predate on humanity guys again quite rude
1,really bad experience play this game my account almost lost i try to log into my pc account but cannot i even create other email to log in by using facebook and twitch but also cannot what is wrong with this company i cannot imagine ppl spending so much then their account been hack so far i can only play at my phone but it is really bad experience especially play at abys
1,exploring underwater is so bad the unnecessary censorship makes a disturbing focal point and annoys the hell out of me when doing combat or puzles stop bringing chinas censorship in global it is so annoying even tower of fantasy does not have that kind of annoying feature
1,this game is designed to make money compared to honkai star rail or any other gacha game from china or japan e giga blue archive arknights colorful stage azure lane and the list goes on and on genshin is lacking a lot of quality of life features from honkai and is unlikely that they will manage to complete the teyvat roadmap smoothly
1,do not bother playing if you are looking for action packed adventure game it is literally a freaking visual novel with combat sprinkled here and there no end game no purpose to build your characters just running around picking mint that is what you do in this game
1,bad security i tried to get into my account just to be told my account is not exist instead the email changed lodged the report yet they told they cannot resolve the issue what are you talking about i grinded account and top up and then all you can say is you cannot solve it
1,please if you are new do not try this game not enough currency for you to catch up to the game banners also every time they release events they are super long and not rewarding or they are super short with hardly any rewards
1,i love this game but it absolutely eats up my storage i have deleted most to all my photos and videos plus any other apps i still cannot install the full game this happens every single update and now i cannot even download this update i physically cannot play the game i have spent money on this game countless hours and now i cannot even play it i have been a very supportive fan of the game but this is absolutely unbelievable i do not know how i can get back if anyone knows please help
1,the game is laggy even on the lowest graphics the controls are a little bit clunky but the game is good just do not expect it to be amazing experience
1,it got even more sucks after update starting from problem occurred with the server frequent reconnections even when ping and internet connection were good trying to using three different isps using vpn but still same problem was not only with wireless connection on smartphone but also when using cable connection on pc
1,honest review from a adventure rank player genshin is not worth your money so do not ever think about spending too much money on it the artifact drop is insanely annoying you will be stuck grinding for one artifact that you need then it will just roll on def and hp absolute bullsh the rewards are almost nothing they also love adding new bosses but never increase how much rasins you get and this game is not even the favorite child i used to love this game but now maybe other games are moreworthit
1,this game is incredible in every way story gameplay design etc but the massive problem is the greedy and stingy development the ability for free to play players to get the in game currency is so slow that it takes multiple months to get a five star character not even mentioning losing the the anniversary rewards suck and when you finally get the five star you want you have to spend multiple weeks getting them good artifacts whose rngs are literally meant to give you bad stats like def and hp
1,even account creation process was close to impossible to complete hire some better user interface designers who has idea that wide on screen keyboard was horrible registration process to say the least uninstalled
1,i have been playing adventure rank for three years i am tired of this game it is a stingy game with prizes spends a lot of money in the end the game is monotonous not to mention those who do not spend money they just keep losing just a suggestion give gifts do not be stingy it is the turn of the honkai game to give lots of gifts i feel like i am going to quit i am tired of this game i am will not touch this game again thank for the three years genshin what about the anniversary gift just the same last year
1,i hate the wishing thing because of how hard it is to get a character i hate how hard it is to get primo and i heard that they are going to adding triple banners in stead of double and double is already hard enough i am not happy about this and i have been playing this game for three years
1,takes hours to install did not play cos it is just too time consuming to even try and load it up and i am running a brand new phone with great internet speeds
1,why genshin hates it is players so much i been playing the game since and we have so many problem and complain some of the are got fixed but it is nothing coplmpare to what they should do like everything we ever wanted is in honkai star rail why i mean most of our problem got fixed but in a defferent game it is really duspointing and so carefree if can do it in other games why not implant the same ferure in our game why cannot we just play the game we like and enjoy make gi like honkai star rail
1,before release i was trilled for elemental reactions mechanics unfortunately the game is more focused on being a talking simulator with endless unskippable dialogues do not get me wrong world mysteries are intriguing but i spent hour minute on one hangout quest literally only chatting with characters and i have more like it developers should heed player feedback for improvement i am short on playtime and i cannot be the only one who has been requesting a skip button since season right
1,when i first started half of my gameplay was straight up talking and of the rest was finding the quest the early game prevents beginners of this game to not be able to play it at all
1,for getting a character you have to play and getting that character you want is have chance this game making you pay for it and there says yeah bruh our game is free to playand you no need to pay for this game why why wish for a character why luck its have no mean here just pay and pay and pay this game is very stingy and after a short time you cannot progress without spendin i really hate this system
1,ever since fontaine dropped my game kept lagging and crashing constantly when it never did that before even when i am in mondsadt it is laggy now and reading the reviews i have found out that this is happening to nearly everyone so it is a game problem not a phone problem
1,switching account requires lots of data to redownload all the deleted files even if you cancelled switching you are obligue to download huge files
1,honestly i love this game and am absolutely disappointed i have to leave such a bad review on this however with me previously being a really hardcore player so much so i would even spent money on this game it is really irritating that since i do not have access to my pc i can no longer play even though i have a compatible android everytime i install i get to play for five minute and then it crashes i will relaunch get in the game and it crashes within a few seconds of me clicking into any menu
1,absolute lack of qol features ruin the game years in no reserve resin stamina claims to be a story focused game but quests constantly lock each other out for arbitrary reasons they attempted to fix this with a suspend quest feature in but is incredibly limited
1,i love this game let us begin there that is why i am looking forward it to improve i love the stetics music and graphics of the game i would love to get to the end of the story and keep playing however during three years player have been asking to improve things like the resin system or add valuable content or quality life but all of our opinions are not taken into consideration and as a player i feel the company only sees us as money and does not give importance to the well being of pys
1,i got the game on my chromebook due to it being too large for my cell phone and even with intel core i and irisx graphics the shaders kill the game before it can fully download i did not want to stop playing but i have been forced to stop
1,genshin impact is such a rip off i regret downloading genshin impact cause i saw this game in the internet and i really wanna download it when the download is finished i put my user and password i tap the begin and wait a couple minutes and then i saw an error that said insufficient storage space please ensure sufficient space and try again code but my game is not much so i deleted some of my games and it did not work so i deleted genshin impact
1,overall i like the game but the artifact farming is truly trash the rng system seriously kill me i spent more than one year just to farm artifact for only one character and still not finished i keep get trash artifact stat this is one of the fun killer in this game
1,the weapon banner system is the worst and makes the game the worst possible please use a different algorithm otherwise the game is pretty much for the rich people to be honest
1,do not download on computer or phone i got this on my computer it has good speed and can run much faster and full programs i was on one part for minutes that should take due to the game not responding no damage was being done and i was frozen unable to move it is said to work on mobile but that is complete bullshit i would use my console a switch but no it is not on there which genshin said it would be on switch three years ago
1,the game is beautiful but only beauty is not enough for gamer we need a simulated universe a rogue like battle mechanic system its been three years i have been with this game and i think its about time i play new games rather than stick to a lost cause a lost battle peace
1,i hate this app i wish i can rate it a zero star the challenges are annoying and an error happened again i was doing a challenge and there was still three seconds left on the timer i killed all the monsters but it still said challenge failed i did it five more times and still challenge failed
1,personally its a wonderful game except the huge space needed for it lots of people i know had to get a new device because of this and worst no one is fixing this although people write this they do not answer and do stuff to make it even more storage please fix this
1,this game is a huge waste of time it is just a place to dump your wallet and be satisfied i am an free to play free to play player and low spender genshin i have lost countless in a row and i am not too mad about it however i have been wishing for wriothesley in genshin impact since his release and still have not gotten him i spent a bit on his banner and lost my and now i am stuck thinking about my choice all i ask is for a better wishing system you probably will not read this as usual
1,i hate this company and this game the wors anniversary event they made us wait for nearly the whole month without any info and some people are still waiting for their rewards people that participated in this event after deadline got rewards and people that did everything right did not get any i have no words it cannot be worst do not download this game it is awful stingy greedy
1,my account still not recovered even i have already sent many messeges in customer service via in game feedback and email please respond because its almost a year that i have not access to my genshin account that keeps lagging in the element loading screen each time i try to open it but it will not let me in and i try creating another account but after reaching the new map in my new account lag then i will not let me in just like what happened to my last account please respond and help me
1,i installed the game on my new phone i got and it finishes loading and immediately crashes and sends me back to my home screen i did not spend two hours downloading and installing the game just to have it crash before i can really get my enjoyment out of it if this issue is resolved i will continue playing the game but until then i am pretty disappointed
1,our account has been hacked and sent an email on the cs email they sent us a ticket to reclaim it back but they have not email us back or helped us to retrieve our account it would be helpful if there is a landline to talk to someone resolve the issue with their loyal players and consumers
1,i am not satisfied anymore it feels like a daily chore that i must be done it so frustrating that ever since inazuma i always have bad luck on getting my weapon maybe i should quit so must stress playing this game same with star rail i only started chapter one and was burned out easily
1,most obtainable characters are archer based and they all suck and each character is specific to a weapon which makes the game really boring and forced you guys need to stop stealing money from people for a game like this it is immoral tower of fantasy got it right while you all continue to suck
1,i have played this game since it is second anniversary and i must say it was a fun experience until the bliss faded and i saw it for what it truly is a cash grab no good events tedious story horrible rng and most of all the pity system and the complete lack of empathy for the free to play players it says third anniversary but it is really just two ten pulls that is it no love or effort other gacha games give more but this this is just utter garbage save yourself do not play this trash
1,my account data was deleted after a while of not playing and never received a reply after sending an email about it new account is unable to connect to hoyoverse as it tells me there is no data under the email or gives me the name of a different traveler constantly running into issues like this and it truly is not worth it for a game that encourages you to spend unrealistic amounts of money to achieve anything
1,the game counted with excellent music and great experience but this new update has given nothing but less rewards for the users the chest amount has reduced and even if the quality of those has increased the total reqards are less compared to the previous version the treat to players is getting worse with poor support and poor rewards compared to the resources and effort spent if i had to resume it is a great game with poor rewards unless you are willing to spend quitr lot of dollar
1,why is it that every time i log in to my first account it always freezes and restart by itself when i log in to my second account it does even though i still have a lot of storage please fix it
1,i love the game but when came back after a few months i got a notification saying please make sure you have enough storage something like that but i have eight gigabyte gigabyte i do not understand how i do not have enough storage too play this game i do not know why i uninstalled everything on my phone launched the game and still no storage even you installing and reinstalling the game it will not work so please if you can fix this that would be great
1,this game does not respect your time these unskippable story plays one line at a time and are stupid and shallow it is a pain to go through also the devs sens of games difficulty is just give enemies more hp or give them five sec invincibility to stall for spiral abyss also recently the abyss enemys can oneshot heros out of the blue devs are not skilled enough to make a good combat system and the artifact farming is a pain the worst of all the game lags like it is running a powerpoint slide
1,this is awful game i have many negatives this game why waste primo choice five star character or weapon i suggest only five star character and this delete is weapon game please fix why each primo for choice five star character or weapon waste primo i do not like this is game i am quit this is game and other problems very slow run for gas climbing exp adventure full heal for characters swimming playing cards jump up fly too many chests and others please fix
1,old i love that the game even though is clearly marketed for profit still provides plenty of opportunities for free play so therere plenty of ways to get just as good of a gaming experience regardless of whether or not you wanna pay real money update wrong money grab after the first week of playing also cannot even log in anymore says network timeout after the dumb intelligent verification pop up
1,this is staying one star until i get my proper cake memorabilia the base game is fantastic but the devs in charge keep making progressively stupider decisions given this used to be my favourite game for like two years straight i am incredibly pissed off fix dehya
1,i reinstalled it bec a friend plays it but it still is boring there is no reason for me to do quests events that require certain progression is too far out so i do not bother and even if i do the rewards aint worth it even doing just the dailies get too boring new characters just muddle the character pool and there is too many even if you get one character it will still be lackluster because you do not have the contellation unlocked chasing everything will feel like a chore so i do not bother
1,worst game and most awful game i have ever played in my life just a waste to time and money if you spend the pity system did not guarantee anything i have played it for five months but i did not even got a single five star i would definitely recommend not to download this game
1,only gave it one stars because i cannot change the controller type i want to use a external controller like a backbone but it will not let me change it fun game but sucks playing by touch screen
1,i had not played the game for a few months and i thought about redownloading it i do not know why but while downloading additional packages the game just crashed i tried restarting the app and even reinstalling it but it does not work please fix
1,i will speak on behalf ofplayers myself included who have stop playing this game for religious reasons that have made it difficult for us to play it there are terms that i hope will be changed in the game so that all players especially muslims can try the game and redownload it including changing the word god to a ruler or something similar the worship of the state of the seven to anything that indicates a meaning that is its not synonymous with worship we would be grateful
1,years anniversary but still no controller support for android for mihoyo inc kind of disappointed could not even making it happen and one more thing switch version still not released yet even though the trailer is released longer than the game itself what a shame seriously what a shame
1,if you put money into this game and you lose access to your account it is gone they make you fill out a form and then just reject it i have tried a thousand times and they still will not help me out so play it if you want but do not give them your money not worth it at all
1,very bad this fairy thing is annoying the story of the city is boring and the god fenti of the game story is weak deleted before continuing the story from how boring the game and story were
1,why are the livestream code expirations sooner i missed the livestream because i was at work i come home to relax and hop on to claim the codes and they are already expired it is still the same day i have been playing this game for over three years and it seems like they are just getting stingier with the primo this is ridiculous
1,this is game is terribly frustrating mintue cutscenes everyone two minute i am not playing a game at this point just reading must be three hours of cutscenes an minute gameplay absolutely ridiculous a game is just watching cutscenes
1,amazing game great open world beautiful music and character design that is just simply amazing but what is sucks and bothering me is that the main character is weak so weak that any other character can surpass the traveler with ease i have been playing this game for two years the traveler has not received any buff that makes them even useable kindly make the traveler powerful so we can actually use them in story instead of using out of story characters to finish the quest
1,i do not know why but i cannot download the resources even if i have enough resources i tried many times to download resources by redownloading genshin and even restarting my phone but it still will not work please fix this
1,i am writing as an avid player of genshin impact and i have been enjoying the game immensely since its eight months however i am facing a significant issue that i believe needs attention – the excessive storage consumption of the game on mobile devices and also have lagging low fps problem etc the dialogue in this game is too frequent and way too long it is also frustrating as player cannot skip dialogues and cinematics please add an option to skip dialogues and cinematics
1,cannot play getting insufficient storage error there is plenty of storage on my phone tried another device and got the same message
1,i could not even play it it said something like to much app space when i had like games and this youtuber said its a good game well i cannot even play it and i had to delete almost all of my games so who ever made this is stupid
1,there is nothing good i can say about the game the characters are uninteresting the gameplay itself is horrible the dialogue is bad and the game is overall just not worth the storage space
1,bought a battlepass gnostic hymm it does not work but my google play balance was deducted it does not appear at transaction history the customer service only tell me to file a complaint at google play and google play cs is a bot its the same as asking me to gtfo after taking my money i am really disappointed
1,great story ost graphics with scamming wish mechanics that rips off players from having any kind of fun people behind marketing teams that only thinks of revenue can go suck themselves it will not be long till this game fall from grace
1,zero controller support for android although you can play this game on ps with a controller or better yet you can play with a controller on iphone add controller support i will give five stars
1,disappointing i was looking forward to playing this on mobile for portability but i keep getting an error saying i do not have enough memory how is it seriously bigger than gigabyte i guess i will just keep playing on pc
1,new update excited for furina here comes another problem ignoring all the crashes and freezing i could not update genshin i had enough space the internet connection is alright but it just says cannot update genshin i had to redownload it a few times taking so much data please fix this
1,edit i tried to login after the update i have pre download the game content but when i try to login today the game told me to download all past quest resources approx gigabyte i have done all quests in the other region i am already so far in the game story why would i need the resources to do quests in monstadt please fix this
1,backbone controller support would open up the game to many android players will improve my score once it or any other controller support on android is implemented
1,this game is trash since raiden shogun first release i start playing i can see there is no improvement for story side quest main story world quest and others way too boring and time consuming
1,this game has so much potential i really love this game but i just do not know its like the devs are not focusing on what makes most player will enjoy more in my opinion the most crucial thing about genshin impact is a repeatable content that you can do every day that will fully utilize your built character that you have grind for more than months i believe if they can find a way to solve this genshin impact will be much more enjoyable for casual players out there f you hoyoverse
1,there was a issue with the storage and which i am very confused so i look at my storage and is completely fine like it could fit gigabyte and i still do not understand why and how but please fix this issue
1,i really like this game but why am i stuck like the loading is taking so much time and there is blank page like the sound is okay but i cannot play the game i wait for so long please fix this i am stuck at matsuke level
1,this is the worst game i have ever played i was lagging like crazy and i have the newest phone also how hard it is to level up without spending money this game is pay to win do not get this game
1,its literally fine for me my only problem is that my genshin account will not log in on my facebook account hoyo please fix it it said it is not matching with the app i would i did not even pressed anything and it log out on my account please hoyo fix it
1,there is a bug there is no scaramouche scene in my archon quest and then just teleport to fontaine no scene that i can name him no scene that i fight with wanderer i crying over night because of this because wanderer is my favorite character and i do not experince his scene fix it
1,this game is kinda fun but it does not fit the game universe and is more cinematics than gameplay and i am mad because i do not like skipping cutscenes what if i miss something
1,the game is biased when doing wishes you can spend more than primo and still no get the character just like me i spent more than primo but still cannot get the seasons character
1,this took my half an hour to make an account and i cannot even play it basically i do not have enough storage space i deleted games deleted all of my video left to photos screenshots in my deep clean and i have a single video left over from not deleting it
1,i quit this game after playing it for almost three years spending over dollar k no regrets because this game greedy low rewards compared to even other hoyogames weap banner is a garbage with rate guarantee time consuming disrespectful to working people every new patch made it worse large space same rewards rng events with no option to do it on weekend probably the worst game in terms of qol the newest hoyogame is honkai star rail but recent four patches made more improvements than gensh in years
1,years in and still overly reliant on dumb fomo mechanics it is strange because the developers other popular game star rail is not like this really disappointing
1,will not even let me login i have deleted everything off of my phone and i pay dollar a month for extra giga for my games there is no way this is that large my man hopefully it is not a scam to download viral things
1,great game every time i try to log in though it lazily does not hing no matter what login method i use nothing happens no message nothing
1,game lay is slower than my grandma in gift shop after gigabyte of downloads you are treated with an extra minute cut scene because who does not like cut scenes and pointless npc chat this game is an artistic waste of time
1,there is no controller support for android such a major flaw and such a put off for playing the game i will not be bullied into buying an apple for a game
1,the game is too blurry even in highest graphics and it needs to be optimized i am using samsung galaxy ultra and for some reason it is really blurry and not enjoyable
1,i still have not played this yet due to the lack of controller support i really want premium game experience on android
1,i have been playing this game since the first month of the game released the story is good but not all of them it is a fun action adventure game but have no options to let the player to skip dialogue in a story quest especially for the side or a daily commisions quest please add this feature so player who more interested in exploration and combat can focus and enjoy to the part of the game that they like my review may will not be noticed and will be answered by a bot but at least i already tried
1,so if you pay for the welkin moon pass which gives you primo per day why do you miss out on those primo if you do not login if someone pays for something they should receive it whether they login or not i will not be spending money on this game anymore it is the same events over and over and they take too long to release map updates which is the only thing that gives a change of pace since they refuse to add endgame content also takes up too much space gigabyte
1,i waited hours for the game to download even though it kept crashing while doing so and when it finally finished i was stuck on a white screen and the dialoug plus voice acting was lagging very badly i even deleted two games i just downloaded hoping for less lag but still no difference also it would make me load the shaders twice and after that make me load the data all over again seeing by how many people have also said this and other things i do not think this is right for me rn
1,so first of all when i installed it it was fine and all then i went into another app saving my progress and then all of my progress was gone please fix this
1,after the update i was playing two of the quest in fontai and then the screen suddenly froze i tried to exit the game or do something that could move the game but it would not work after a few minutes my phone restarted on itself when i tried to load back genshin my loading screen froze i saw another review here that had the same problem as me so please hoyoverse fix this error
1,it is been two days i cannot log in to the game is there any problem for malaysia region tried every known connection possible internet connection giga and even giga but nothing good happens
1,after al this time we can stil not change servers without losing all progress this is honestly shameful and sad i cannot play with a large part of my friends and people moving countries get devastated by this too allow server transfers add a yearly cooldown if your afraid of abuse it would not be so bad to start over either if i where just allowed to skip dialogue and cutscenes
1,my account got hacked i am seeking help on the cs team but their response is so slow hope you put some efforts on the players that has problems like this
1,so much my needed to just open the app and even if you delete all the apps you still get the message insufficient space and i have deleted everything and still it is saying
1,i am truly disappointed at this game now at the beginning it was okay but now everything is too expensive from a free to play players pov if you want a character you have to save up primo that are hard to farm for and the anniversary did not even give us much which just shows me that mhy does not truly care about the players there are so much bugs in the game and the company is just blatently ignoring the bad reviews this is not ok star rail on top
1,this game is one of my favorite games but even though i have lots of space for the updates it does not download i do not know why and also it is lagging even though i have a gaming phone please developers fix this issue this game is my most favorite game of all games and i do not want to stop playing genshin for this malfunction please fix it thank you
1,no matter how much storage i free over gigabyte it still says that there is not enough storage i have been forced to play on my laptop but recently that broke so i tried to download it on my phone and it is not working please can i have some help with this
1,game keeps constantly crashing i am on a motorola giga stylus but i cannot go seconds in game without a crash if i do not crash before getting in the game please tell me how to fix this so i can play
1,star unless the upcoming in game anniversary rewards are good enough yeah it is worse literally the same shlt with previous anniversary nothing changes you are doing great hoyo please keep the consistency so i can keep giving a star review
1,i will tell you how the game play is if i ever actually get to play it so far it is been two days of sucking up data giga worth so far and loading bars this game better be epic
1,this app collects everything you do on your device your internet activity everything you type ip address mac address passwords phone number and more this should not be required to play this game you are giving up all privacy rights
1,gi is really a good game i am playing in mobile that is why it is convenient to play however the recent fontaine update the game constantly reconnecting to server and i am seriously annoyed my internet connection is so strong enough that i can play other games smoothly please fix it hoyoverse
1,do not believe the hype this game is nothing as advertised i have been playing for almost a month now with all my characters at a minimum of level there is no deep water swimming you can only swim on the surface there is a limit of four people including yourself that can be in your server at a time there is no global server where players can meet greet and pvp there are areas where you cannot explore and attempting to enter them could result in the game forcing your character to kill itself
1,do not get it i have giga network with great signal and i started the download at noon and it is pm and it still has not downloaded completely finally downloaded it and it crashed my brand new tablet i uninstalled it immediately talk about a waste of time and space if there is permanent damage to my tablet you will hear about it
1,dear genshin impact please make the time much longer on level ascension i feel like i do not have a very good aoe damage and this was like week that i have been stuck on adventure rank please change and it make it to five minutes not two minutes
1,the game is great and they have very cool characters but i think that we should get more primo bit is very hard to win character banners or make it a little easier to get characters and hoyoverse should stop whitewashing characters and making their skills racist and do research to make the new places good
1,i have lost six times in a row and to make it worse my friend has won all of them this is making me distressed it feels like am being targeted i have played this game for over days and no way did i feel rewarding please fix my account wishing system
1,i cannot log in it said i had bad network when i just bought a new internet connection it also had perfect timing i was at pity and i was pulling for hu tao and then the next day boom i cannot log in anymore i tried deleting it and downloading it back but it is still the same i guess i am never gonna have hu tao i guess the game did not want me to have my first star character
1,this game is very boring there is no story the gameplay is monotonous and the graphics suck even for a mobile game in general i do not recommend downloading it
1,im giving this one star because when i install the the login and try to download the resources it says that i have sufficient space the size was giga bytes and i have giga of free space but still this happens i try to delete three giga of space but you should fix that
1,i hate genshin i do not care for the game or the content creators making stuff about it yet youtube is pouring it down my throat like boiling salt i have no interests in genshin impact and the ads make me hate it more because it is just a random dude being like you just gotta explore man and find what you like in the world while the worst world animation happens even calling it world animation is generous it looks worse than a ps game most of the time
1,i have a problem i love the game and have been playing it for a while but since the ladt update i have this issue where after i am at the last loading screen it will not open the game i can hear the music and sound but not the screen
1,game is fun tons of stuff to do a lot of characters to play events are always available a gigantic world to explore and different kinds of enemies and challenges are present the devs do not listen to the fanbase either increase the resin cap or rate of resin reset per minute rng is garbage the bad gacha rng is already a given its the staple of all gacha games but the artifact rng is bad talent mats are low in game drops are low why do the redeem codes have extremely quick expirations
1,do not play on mobile it looks terrible play on pc new characters like neuvilette also want you to use dpi mouse so you can hit all enemies simultaneously cannot do that in mobile
1,patch has been the worst this game has ever released it is boring and the new characters are terribly designed there has been massive backlash hoyo ignores it do yourself a favor and avoid any of their games a company that cannot acknowledge and fix their errors does not deserve your time money or attention also very stingy their anniversaries are always terrible and do not show appreciation for their players
1,the game is amazing annd no complaints about it but i made an acedental purchase and when i requested a refund i got a email that my account is banned so yeah i am giving this game a one star do better hoyoverse
1,this is day in the game is still loading this game sucks that is why i am not going to play this game anymore can you guys just make the game where it automatically gets in the game and and stop loading and taking days
1,the game is very fun but the resin system needs work and the gatcha is is extremely frugal also the anniversary event is terrible
1,do not download the game because your fingers will bleed the game does not support controllers on android and playing too much is unhealthy and will cramp your fingers
1,cannot even start this game as it tries to download something and says i have insufficient space i cannot stop the download even though the option is there as the notice comes up immediately
1,new character is broken good try on getting us to spend sorry power creep does not work on me and killing off all of my old constellationr is the last straw fix your power creep else i quit bye
1,i have deleted almost everything on my tablet and still cannot play i was at world level or something and now i cannot even get into the game there has got to be a way to make it use less storage please i really want to play
1,i am not able to open the game whenever i open it shows me that please connect to the internet or check your network eventhough i am connected with the stable internet
1,what kind of game is this ai have more than gigabyte remaining but resources not downloading it says insuffecient storage how many gigabyte do you need for you to allow me to download the resources fix this i played the game before and it did not asked me to free the space
1,the company have no plan for end game content and fontaine daily quest always got stuck at the coffee shop so much quest needed to be clear to just do the daily quest so annoying
1,it would keep on kicking me out of the game around when downloading the shaders which is weird because i also play on ps and mobile and that has never happened before i am writing this review about my laptop
1,once i log in to update the newest update they keep saying that i have insufficient storage and error but my storage is fine i have tried more than five times
1,the anniversary rewards are still the same for three years well i already set my expectation low so it is nothing special when it comes to genshin anniversary it is just another normal day moreover dehya is still underwhelming and need to be fixed
1,i think the update is a downgrade in terms of performance graphic quality and size of the game in storage even though i have a good chipset i have unpleasant experience in this patch and it will possible to carry it in future update please address and fix it developer
1,what is even downloading resources it kept on saying downloading resources downloading resources it is been like three days since i installed it and it kept on saying that downloading thing over and over again it is so frustrating i do not what you gonna do but remove that downloading thing or do something about it the graphic design good but since i cannot play with game i am giving it one star
1,help me i am having a bug and i cannot enter the game it said i may be having a bug or i needed to update the game it would not let me play the game it exits the game after the hoyoverse title pops up help please
1,a decent game with decent stroy telling with a very dissapointing gacha rates and i know genshin just made to become a cash cow to develop other hoyo games this game are truly another pinnacle of trash game and i am still confused about why people still play this abomination i mean come on it is true that the developers of this game just a bunch of sadists that just need a players that pay they do not fucking care with free to play see the reward that this game gives they do not care about free to play
1,hoyoverse please give an option to change storage location to sd card or move some part of the game to sd card in android i cannot download the game because of limited storage my phone is only gigabyte i do not know if it is possible to do what i requested but if an option like that is available it will make it easier for us android players
1,having actually played the game for hours during betas unlike those dumb review bombers i can say that whether you are a casual player in for the one time experience or a hardcore daily grinder that this game has something for you to do and to just sit back relax and explore the many mysteries in the open world unfortunately mihoyo has done so many shady things over the years so we gonna have to drop the rating
1,the game is good but now that the new update got released i tried to log into the game but it just will not log in i tried everything i could to log in and it just will not i tried re installing resetting internet connection even though my internet connection is alright i tried to restart my phone then redownload but it still did not log in i even tried to search how to deal with the error and followed but it still does not seem to log me in i tried to switch my internet and it still does not let me in
1,after the last update i really just want to play the game why i cannot do it i do not want to head on over to hoyolab to discuss new content i just want to play the game and when i tap the cancel that message come over again
1,cannot skip all dialogue all at once and wasting time just for dialogue cannot play long cause of working please fix this
1,all fake reviews flag them that said game is almost entirely pay to play after characters hit level do not make the mistake of raising your adventurers rank you will regret it doesnt say it ramps difficulty up exponentially i was barely beating enemies at level that are level it is slanted towards the game to force you to buy characters and upgrades it is a scam of sorts to frustrate you into paying to advance the game or endlessly grind for months
1,you guys need to fix your reward system i do not understand how it gets worse the more you progress through the game also why is the resin still capped at imagine paying for or grinding for characters which you cannot use greedy little goblins
1,genshin i have a problem with the game my problem is when i login they say network error please check your network and try again please fix it i do not want to lose my account so please fix it soon
1,i like that game but i cannot enter it took three hours but i cannot enter so i cannot play i play genshin impact with my sisters phone i hope it works and people can enter hurry that is all but it is a amazing game
1,after years of waiting still no controller support for android so one star still live on feels like apple has pay mihoyo to not giving android controller support scum apple or scum for both apple and hoyoverse even at still no controller support for android heck you give starrail android controller support from the get go that further proven that you make a deal with apple
1,i hate his because the game itself has so much storage how much more the updates please fix this if you do not then first of all do not you feel bad for the mobile players they literally have to delete everything just to play this game so please please please fix this
1,greedy company that does not reinvest into the game to keep its experiences fresh and fix in game lip sync with voice lines will only get worse over time
1,there is something wrong i cannot log in i mean i will get to log in but once it gets to the seven element loading screen they just will not show up and so the white screen is forever there and i have tried force stop uninstall log out then log back in and i for real need a grind for furina you all ugh
1,as an adventure rank player i can say that the scenery exploration and story is quite good however the gacha aspect is extremely predatory and the company is one of the greediest giving barely any currency for gacha it will take you months to save up for a five star character and you may not even get the one you want only play it if you are going in for pure exploration and story and have good self control
1,getting issue always i get a blank white screen after i click on tap to begin and after that nothing happens facing this issue since from past few weeks and i am unable to open game
1,keeps lagging even with low settings my game keeps freaking out and glitches terribly i do not know what to do besides wait hours to reinstall it and uninstall it constant flickers
1,i hate it when the screen turns black and i have to read what should be a cutscene the game is popular hard to believe they do not have the money for it
1,hello my name is david i have a ten year old daughter that download this game and wasted almost all her storage she keeps begging for crystal for something called primoujems of course we did not buy her any but she keeps talking about how much she likes a character named worlfwarthesllay it is a hard name she keeps asking me for primoujems to roll for him so we sent her to sleep in the church and be dumped in holy water stay save my childrens
1,talking about game technically so far i have no problem but the story line is not good especially the part where you add or describe characters as gods and you have to choose worship in order to gain benefits of game i really really wish if that was not the case games should be devoid of religion the religion aspect of fantasy makes people like me who are faithful to one religion very uneasy kindly do not make games based on religious fantasy so that is why i am uninstalling it
1,i gave this an one star because last time i log out i was adventure rank and when i came back i was back at adventure rank one i do not know what happened but i tried to email hoyovers but it did not work i lost so many progress in this game and it did not even save
1,its a really fun game but i hate how it takes up so much storage i really hope that the storage that the resources need will get lowered because i miss playing this game with my bestfriend
1,after the latest update the adventure rank ascension three become so hard all character have max up still cannot pass the level the time limit is to short all characters level weapon level artifact level t talent all up to level
1,i love this game so much but now everytime i try to enter in the pc it just freezes before it can even start loading
1,this game is bias to liyue characters since they always have events but nations like inazuma barely have focus events i swear this game hate inazuma because it is based on japan and has extreme bias to liyue because it is china i am sick of seeing zhongli venti hu tao and xiao on every event
1,i need that hoyoverse release a software for gamepads on android i can believe that we already had this game for three years and we still cannot play with controllers on android
1,it is spending your money on other endeavours and it shows does not want to pay it is english voice actor stories drone on with no crescendo and some areas are mechanically busted players are hostile toward the company the game and eachother they could remedy this by rewarding players so new bad kids are not so bad or by revamping a tired money mill of a gatcha system that permeates all aspects of the game with trash items weapons and artifacts they will not fix these problems
1,still no controller support for android gigabyte asking for eight more gigabyte for a total of gigabyte of space and no offline mode lmao not thank you i could play different games for the same space.
1,so here we are again i am still rating one star because the recent quest is so boring and a whooping eight hours plus quest why cannot you just put some skip for people that does not have time to do you are quests
1,after downloading additional resources the game kept on loading and all of sudden the application is closed i am not able to start playing
1,when i try to play it first time there is a black screen issue how much i try i cannot enter in the game please clear this bug
1,the game does not have much content now and you can burn throught the quests fast and it will then become a boring game cause all that is left to do are dailies which are repetitive
1,dev should add skip button it is so annoying to listen story that you do not want to or your playing alternative account in game you have to speak one hundred of npc to kill one monster and you cannot skip single conversation and some of them too boring
1,trying to get your hands on the characters you are fond of or artifacts that meet your demand it is simply a headache the game can ruin your good mood and empty your wallet yet it is really beautiful so if you insist on downloading it you should just stick to the stories not the numbers ps characters in this game follow this principle the newer the better try not to waste your resources on older ones unless you like them
1,when i put my facebook account it is not working and when i put my twitter account it is not working i do not know why it is not working so please creator fix the problem right away because i want to play it
1,i download the internal memory two months ago when i open it after updating it my internal memory download was reset and i was very frustrated at that time please help me what i can do
1,when came this game is does not let me enter i keep restarting my phone and tried a many solution but still did not work i am stuck at the geo sign loading screen and it warning me that user interface is not responding please fix this hoyoverse many people too having this error especially those who are low storage i love this game but it so laggy and keep crashing and now i am stuck at the loading geo sign
1,i love the game but so many flaws are not easy to overlook they powercreep characters as if people getting good characters would hurt their business will not give voice over for important stories and the stories contain names i cannot pronounce or remember so cannot care there are more annoying issues like these recently fontaine update came and they changed their system requirements what about the people who started playing before because they found a game that ran in their pc and now it does not
1,tos not loading i am using a laptop this works perfectly fine on my phone except my phone is broken and i cannot get the game to load past the login screen because when i try to load the tos they do not load i get a blank screen no matter how long i leave it to load i really wish that you could just check the box instead of going to the bottom of the tos like come on we all know no one reads those things anyways this makes this game literally unplayable for people like me makes me sad
1,i have played this game before and everything seems perfectly fine the graphics are good and the music is amazing but the only issue i am having at the moment is with the storage i have deleted almost all my apps and i have more than enough space for this game but it still says i have insignificant storage i have looked up ways to fix this problem but so far nothing is working i have seen some other people struggling with this too and i hope it gets fixed soon
1,i love this game but the storage requirements are absolutely abysmal i am adventure rank right now and now i cannot play on both my laptop and phone because of this i have decent base storage on both but even after deleting all of my apps and unnecessary data i was still far from the storage i needed i wish hoyoverse would offer more extreme low graphics quality options to fix this
1,i love this game play it for hours almost everyday but its beyond ridiculous how much space it is taking up right now it takes up gigabyte on my phone the newest update is gigabyte i legitimately have no choice but to uninstall i play with my settings low i do all i can to make sure this game runs smooth and beautiful and it is still not enough
1,i heard so much of of this app and i was so excited to play it but when i installed it and wanted to play they started giving me insufficient storage space please ensure sufficient space and try again code i tried everything and even asked chat gigabytet about it and nothing happend i uninstalled and reinstalled and also nothing happened and they gave me the same thing nonetheless i just hope they can fix this problem cause it is just a shame that this is happening
1,great game in general if it were not for the fact that i came back to log into the game and it threw me about ten levels or more back to the start i lost all my characters my level upgrades ascensions etc and all the places that i traveled on the map i am not sure if i wnat to re play the whole story i am extremely upset and dissappointed
1,the game really need a skip button at least for the side quests and and world quest because is a player is not interested in reading dialogue then what is the point of not letting them to skip the dialogue and waste their time on clicking the screen just what is the difference of not reading the dialogue and skipping the dialogue
1,manuveur in fontaine with mobile is totally horrible ecperience horrible control horrible repeatative challenges that needed to pass through many rings within limited time but it is already almost impossible to control direction and movement simultaneously took half an hour at the same challenge and not even done with downloaded to enjoy but ended up getting frustrated more than anything
1,the game itself is interesting and fun but only if you are willing to pay and keep on paying free to playplayers are treated like trash even if you play constantly for months bad regarding events and very stingy daily check in rewards and always lacking primo only way to purchase good characters and weapons resin gold and so much more that of course can be fixed with an incredible amount of money
1,new fontaine update adds an ugly water bubble diaper to characters when submerged which does not make sense since it does not really obscure anything there was no changes to character models when gliding climbing running swimming or any other time the camera is behind your character but when submerged it looks really awful which is unfortunate since it feels like the majority of the new region is underwater
1,this game was fun to start out great graphics and story the only issue is you will get to a point that you can no longer progress unless you start spending money because in order to upgrade your characters and their weapons you will need to beat insanely harder and much higher level bosses then you can handle and to top it off not only are some of the monsters that you will need to beat much stronger then you are they also added in elements like freezing to death with no way to combat this
1,add a skip button beautiful music open world is great botw feel but some sceneries look way better you get so captivated by everything in the world and you want to explore everything the gameplay is great too yet the story lore of the game is bad super bad and boring there is so much potential to do something greater but it never quite reaches it
1,how much space does this game require i have a gigabyte phone with space free and i keep getting an insufficient space message instead of it doenloading in game resources game never gets past login screen then insufficient space message update sorry but your response is usless obviously it requires more space i asked specifically how much and your response is make sure you have sufficient storage what a non answer waste of time
1,if i could play this game i would but when i hit start game it goes to the code or something about not enough storage so i put is on my sd card with more than enough storage and then i went into the game and it was only a black screen nothing else so i moved it back and then it did the stubid error code i tried every thing but it did not hing can you please fix this because i really want to try playing it but i cannot
1,it is pretty laggy and has some missing chunks using tecno spark it takes me a while to load the game and even walking around and switching characters is taking time i already put the games settings into lowest and still laggy it is a good game i need to play on a different device for better quality and i hope there would be a chance for the size of the game files to be smaller and the developers to at least make it playable on my part because i cannot enjoy the game if it is so laggy
1,gameplay is great music is awesome character design is fantastic but through inazuma they just got lazy with story development but they redeem themselves with sumeru story dialogue however are pretentious and too lenghthy no skip nor story archive milestone reward anniversary new patch etc is pure joke zero respect for its player base the rng for artifacts is just basically punishing player for playing the game the grind is horrible you can farm and grind for months for zero progress
1,i loved it so much but i am disappointed now i need to delete almost everything on my tablet just to make room for this game i understand that it is a big game but you guys seriously need to optimize the file sizes one star i think i speak for almost every mobile player when i the fonatine file size is outrageous i wasted so much money and time on this game and i am one of the unlucky people who does not have a pc or playstation to switch too it is unplayable at this point i am so disappointed
1,waiting for one day that it successfully play on phone with smooth no lag and no over heating my phone but too bad it should not be mobile game anymore have fun outside play with friends but our phones cannot handle it the new map is burning your phone when only gaming minute around play in low graphics also cannot help much all you get are only lag with heating and nearly burning phone better play on pc which requested to gigabyte to download it but still better play on phone
1,this game is not for phones anymore cannot even do cooperative because it is laggy you cannot fight raiden or any of those bosses because yet again laggy and you will just be dead by the time your in this game truly just is not for a phone does not matter which phone it is it sucks and there is no more point of playing it anymore if you cannot even play it these updates are great it is probably a beautiful game on console or pc but it aint for phone or poor people
1,this game is pretty good and i love it dearly but it usually makes me so fed up disappointed and mad because firstly they missed up with the whole sumeru characters designs secondly they do not want to add more abyss challenge increase resin and give buffs to the old characters thirdly the hoyoverse team are not helpful at all whenever i complain about a bug they do not give a helpful answer or they do not respond so i am giving it two stars
1,i was almost adventure rank i have lost access to my account it is still in the game because my friends can still see me in their friend list but i cannot log in anymore for a mistake that i made hoyoverse help center is not helping either with getting me my account back i have spent a lot of time on that account building my characters farming making new friends so if you ever lose access to your account for any reason do not expect to get it back hoyoverse will not help you
1,i hate this game because it does not have a skip button for the dialogue because i have so many story to catch up to the previous one please i have wait for one year to you make the skip button i need it to complete all my mission it make me so sleepy when the talking things please make a skip button for the dialogue please
1,geshin impact its kinda cool all the characters designs etc are so amazing but i have a issue the problem is the storage well i just playing geshin impact i am trying to start the game but did not work plus i delete all the pictures and apps and does not work plus and the downloading screen is kinda slow please fix this issue thank you i hope i can play geshin impact
1,still no controller support for this game even though on all other platforms it has controller support is absolute rubbish this is not a particularly enjoyable experience when played on touch screen which is a shame it seems like there is a good game here locked behind the worst control scheme ever
1,today i played for two hours got bored a while back but decided to give it another try i am adventure rank i fought six enemies for around five seconds and the rest was spent looking at of unskippable boring bad filler dialogue this used to be an amazing game but now it has zero respect for your time there is almost no adventuring and everything that was clever about it is gone new content coming with every update is brainless and painfully boring
1,very fun but can physically no longer run after fontaine update would not recommend to mobile players even if you have the space now you will likely run out with future updates and it will be a frustrating loss of everything you have worked on my laptop cannot even run it
1,frustrating at best not great at being a legit gacha yet not stand alone enough remove micro transactions its a trap its a huge download the cutscenes are choppy eats phone battery like roasted marshmallows maybe you can have better experience on pc or console expect to waste years of life culminating one or more account just to attempt to acquire but not actually get the character you want
1,needs optimization and character balance early characters are almost useless in newer content newer characters need materials from newest bosses even if that character is from the very first region no skip button scene is too long and without akip button is pain
1,the game has progress so far but some of the basic features are not available with the games such as controller support in android however same is available with ios and other platform we love this game but not able to play to fullest
1,the luck system is bullshit even when you spend money it is still rigged i have only gotten what i wanted two times out of the or times i have pulled it gets boring after a few months of playing and as far as the primo bullshit goes they are not only overpriced but the game itself is not generous at all it gives you daily quests for a day and they get very repetitive and very boring fast generally the game is very stingy with giving them out for free given the pity needed to get characters
1,its a worst game ever i played for four months for kazuha i did not got even a good two piece set for kazuha they really test patience untill we give one star review i am adventure rank level wish event is waste i did not got even a five star character in low pity battle pass is unaffordable
1,i overall love the game but i could not get into the game i am currently installing this game again to see if it was a glitch but i really hope i can play this game
1,would recommend nothing will change this not fontaine natlan etc fontaine is boring af the cast feels lifeless except for three people the girls are reduced to pure eye candy the story keeps repeating itself etc and after the treatment of a dehya from sumeru i have no more support for this game after six months of waiting for sumerus best girl they treated her so badly i am done just play honkai impact third instead the devs directly running it know exactly what they are doing
1,if you like reading this is the game for you you spend more time on dialogue with npcs then playing the game
1,the game is cool and all but recently i opened a new account and almost completed downloading my resources but the game had some errors and i had to start all over again i took it lightly and just let it go but it happened to me again and it is not a joke anymore coz downloading the resources takes a lot of time and net you should do something about this the game do not even remember my saved account and i need to start all over again its frustrating
1,i have this problem with genshin with no solution i have been playing this game on my phone for years now since launch and had no problems except for storage i recently moved to pc to play i had no problems installing and running first day second day i played a bit and logged out but i logged in after and after swimming in fontaine for about two seconds the game crashed and kicked me out it never let me back in it gets stuck on loading screen i can still hear paimon when i press esc
1,it is been so long since i won the i am much luckier in star rail that is why i switched to that game my rating is irrevocable until some miracle happens in my genshin acc
1,you have lost your touch thanks for making traveler the most boring mary sue to exist not only the story have been of low quality but the limited timed events seems poorly planned as well this game had so much potential and now it is gotten bland and boring
1,great game as a whole but unfortunately it has a lot of drawbacks it has the worst launcher in the world as you can have a steady megabyte connection but it will always fail to download and you will find yourself downloading from the start again and again it has farming issues resin and a lack of end game content as i find myself with no quests no exploration no content to keep me busy playing the game and no resin to keep farming for my characters
1,i am a player who loves this game i have spent dollar on welkin and battle pass however consecutive losses on the mistsplitter and song of broken pines banners last year along with ongoing defeats in their reruns have changed my feelings the flawed weapon banner system frustrates me this year i lost five times in a row trying to get my desired weapon i can only pull one five star weapon each banner but five consecutive losses are too much i am fed up and considering uninstalling this
1,i keep on losing on limited banners and i got mona qiqi etc which is so annoying they are in the standard banner and yet still in limited banner we got characters from standard banner
1,the new event does not even work properly the enemies will not spawn but the timer still runs
1,hate that you cannot skip the storyline so you are stuck reading dialogue that i am not interested in cannot collect items or chests my friends world and have it count in my world makes exploring and having fun with friends boring because i have to collect the items again in my world most other games have this availability there is so much i cannot do in cooperative mode like events or quests which makes it boring
1,ios has game controller support and for some reason this does not also need a way to get the game working with sd card i want to know why i cannot get half of the games gigabytes on my sd card
1,it takes one hundred years to complete all the quests because you cannot skip the bullshi dialogue pay money to my precious time
1,not sure there are no significant improvement from this game after three years the qol the rewards the events etc totally meh
1,after of my updating of this fame its almost unplayable in dimensity and gigabyte of ram even i look in the sky which is not part of rendering its seems its running at fps below of that please trace the performance issue of this game asap also of taking not even in lowest setting its not helping well seems this game does a frame capping issue
1,terrible story but cannot skip how do you enjoy playing the game if you have to go through a pain staking boring story
1,this game ruined me i hate everything in this game the rates the missions the pity system the artifacts i need that autoclear feature in this game the powercreep is horrendous the fact you cannot skip the story that green grassoculus thingy that took me four hours the optimization the characters except noelle she with my gang and finally no primo one outta go play battle cats an adventure rank
1,game is good with pretty high quality however poor in game purchase experience no confirmation button at all which results my accidental usage of my crystals contacted customer service immediately and they refuse to cancel the transaction note this is not even real money guess what the reason is the transaction is complete
1,i say the game is quite wonderful but the downside is the new region fontaine the region is great and all but it takes a huge toll on my device as in rendering the system user interface and my processor completely and utterly useless making the my phone freeze all of the other regions did not give me that much of a bother this problem came up specially in ann of the narzissenkreuz quest named ann story prologue
1,i do not know what is happening but when i clicked start game it said not enough storage and no matter how many apps i deleted it still said the same
1,graphics became blurry and blocky even if all the settings are set to high hoping that it will be resolved in the future updates
1,the game is fine its good the combat is eh nothing impressive cause the game keeps updating but there is nothing new to the combat issue is the hell is wrong with this game took me an hours to download to play the game very poorly why would you set an openworld single player game to fully dependent on good connection why i cannot play game cassually as the lag of connection keep goes on cannot even play the game as cassual game supposedly yep do not play the game if you have limited time
1,never actually treats it is players especially the loyal ones right been playing for every single day for three years now and i am still dissapointed
1,game worked perfectly fine before ever since the pre installation game takes gigabyte even after clearing all past quest resources and lags a lot and noticed a drop in frame rate needs better optimisation for phones i have enough space to last me a while but game still lags
1,the puzles in inazuma does not make sense and you have to follow walkthroughs on youtube step by step to complete them finally reduced another star even genshin content creators struggle to three star the current abyss if you are free to play stay away from spiral abyss it is a trap that majority of even paying players cannot finish just enjoy the story reduced another two stars cannot do any quests because the quest location is involved with other locations i am this close to uninstalling honestly
1,not even for the third anniversary we received good rewards meanwhile at honkai they give away nice rewards for random events it is a shame because i really liked the game
1,i just updated the app today for the update and for some reason when i tried opening the game it is says i have no storage space for the game for no reason and it is downloading stop at please what is going onhelp
1,the story character and world building are pretty nice however three years into the game and its still filled with so many bugs that they never fix let alone acknowledge spiral abyss dungeon is filled with horrible bugs switching charcter most of the time takes upto three seconds insteaf of one second and do not get me start on enemies
1,leaving this because of unsupported native controller like come on we are already at fontaine and iphones already have the feature
1,its been a while but please make the resin cap higher or reduce resin restoration and if please improve the weapon banner
1,the game is undeniably abysmal especially when it comes to the abysmal chances of obtaining a star item personally i find myself much more enthralled by the captivating graphics and resource acquisition system of honkai impact third unlike genshin impact it excellently promotes resource management and grinding providing a far more immersive and satisfying gameplay experience
1,developer does everything in their power to drip feed players the absolute minimum of in game rewards making everything a chore and so on its god awful and they genuinely do not care about their playerbase as proven by their scummy anniversary rewards which had to be earned by promoting the game through art etc also they delete reviews ban people who speak out against it and restrict any negative pr they get the worst thing the addicted playerbase actually defends them to the core
1,i let the game run figuring it was downloading the content all i was seeing was a floating walkway in front of me taking me to some building like roman through clouds three hrs and it was still on the walkway no game what so ever i think if they fix it the graphics was amazing so i give it a one star great looking walk way but hope that not all you expect people to do in the game is listen to good music and meditate down a path that never ends
1,literally just the shell of a game made to have money poured into it by weebs and whales there is no literally no gameplay other than mashing attack and ability buttons at enemies and hoping their health decreases faster than yours
1,it is very bad because i am on a chromebook and it still shows the setting that you use on an ipad
1,as an end game player i simply cannot recommend this game some four star characters are really strong and you would need to build them in order to progress in your account but guess what there is no guarantee for a specific four star you desperately need also everything in this game is resin gated which is basically time gated you have ten minute of gameplay everyday to progress your account and artifact rng is a curse which will drive you crazy also system for banner five star is not ideal
1,not enough resins full with time base events useless boring cooperative function side quests are better than main quests second anni rewards sucks just make venti meta again please
1,years with the exact same gameplay and combat mechanics getting bored after a few months luckily also mediocre storytelling i played it just as a homework i was used to do daily maybe waiting any improvement or fresh content but that never happened just a bunch of boring recycled events and occasionally a new location to explore just as three years ago when released over and over i am done with this
1,guys i really like this game please make it more cheaper thouu the odds of getting a star character is really hard
1,after the new update the game on my android pixel six pro is unplayable it lags so hard when i use elemental skills or bursts
1,i have just faced the most irritating problem the gigabyte update i have waited for at least four hours to get done was cancelled the last minute by a verification error it is the second time this happened to me and it is really disappointing it is definitely not about my pc my equipment meets all the requirement and standards i just hope they will find a solution about this issue with the launcher edit tried again but no avail and ofc there is no way hoyo will listen to this complaint and solve it
1,this is very good game but size is very long i am not tary it but i see in a youtube that is a very high graphic game please size doing a samll size
1,i have had this game downloaded to my phone for a while i see ads all the time for it but i have yet to be able to play because of the storage issue how much storage does a mobile game need my phone is not a playstation or pc edit twenty giga
1,good game but do not expect anything from the dev when it comes to rewards you will regret it the dev seems to ignore players requests even simple ones like updating the resin system you can play while being free to play if you are lucky or else it is pay to win
1,character level up materials for leveling up talents are very hard to get it is been five weeks and still have not got any tail of boreas it is so frustrating why make the respawn time of rewards be that long why make us wait for another to week just to get what the item we do not need
1,i am giving the one star just for the devs to notice that i want them to bring back events that are more like a actual event like cooperative pve fighting boss with friends together not those boring kids puzle thingy just to claim rewards feels kinds of forcefully and boring everything else is good world exploration and story wise just the events are boring
1,give us graphic pack download option like standard medium and high graphic day by day games size is incrising if it goes on then many people including us mobile player would not able to play the game if this feature add in game then everyone can chose which graphic pack they want like who have higher level devise he she can chose higher graphic option and who has lower devise he can chose standerd or medium graphic pack then many player who has lower devise they able to return
1,breath of the wild clone ruined with insane gacha practically no free rewards quality assurance is near zero takes years to max out a single character over playable characters which is a bad thing this game basically exists to be a cash cow for hoyo minimal reinvestment maximum prices for premium currency glitches galore events are basically only for whales fontaine is garbage and it is been in the works for over a year new gimmicky gameplay sucks
1,the game is beautiful and i love playing it but it needs way to much storage space on the phone if this does not improve for the next big updates basicly nobody will be playing this on mobile what a shame
1,pretty cool just started leaving one star though because i have used two different controllers ps xbox and they do not seem to work for mobile disappointed for such a large install
1,i keep trying to use my account but it says that i have to much storage but i do not or it will say that your password is incorrect when it is not
1,after playing for two weeks now it is continuously showing me connection timeout error after starting the game
1,this game is super not beginner friendly you will not have the materials to build the characters on the banner you pulled for nowadays all the banners are for late game players who are on the latest map ex the banners are fontaine characters but you started at mondstadt you will not have access to the necessary materials until you get to the fontaine map it will take months to reach that map
1,requires significantly more space than for its pc counterpart no amount of file cleaning has allowed this game to fit on my phone
1,this game sucks because it would let continue through the downland resources because i do not have enough space even though i have gigabyte of storage free so tell why this thing will not work
1,the game is good has great story and potential but hoyoverse does not give it much importance they just see it as a cash cow for their other games you can easily see it in the treatment it recieves compared to the rewards in honkai star rail they refuse to acknowledge this games shortcomings and instead improve things in their other games i have never seen such blatant discrimination from a game company trash
1,size of the game is ridicilous it takes a lot of space and the game performance in mobile is worsened the update patch does not give player something like honkai star rail do and a lot of player leaving this game even the new update like fontaine and else i hope at the anniversary later they can do much better improving the game and rewarding the player who still played this
1,greedy chinese company they do not pay the voice actors do not reward the players instead they will spend more money on streamers to market the game they simply want to milk the game such a shame the story and game creators actually are doing a good job however the greedy corporates just care about getting money out of the game
1,add controller support and key bindings for android users too we also love this game and use controllers too do not do discrimination between ios and android users thanks
1,using chrome os it was fine and run smooth before but suddenly it lags so bad and black box on scene such as trees are so annoying i do not know what happened it did not even got an update
1,worst app i tried to play it but it said i had no storage left so i dleated a lot of things still would not let me so i dleated more things and still will not let me
1,when i try to play the game and log it it suddenly freezes and kicks me out of the game and i cannot even play it anymore
1,i used to love the game but the sumeru area lags terribly and i have a rog phone six gaming phone please fix this
1,it has been years since this game has released and there is no android controller support and while their other games have support
1,what happened why i cannot login to the game it only shows up with black screen and then it back to the homescreen i am really disappointed
1,like the game but hyv can do alot better in giving back to their players it is been three years nothings changed rewards in general just not good enough for the amount of time you have to put in
1,skins are too expensive and they are just a few the resin system at max after three years is precarious dialogues are extremely long and most of them are not voiced most events resemble games of a past era they should be focused on the characters of the game and on domains and quests that allow players to use the characters of the game not on unattractive mini games
1,this is a the worst game ever with its dark system it never able to give proper game what a darkest system
1,it has now been two and a half years from innitial release to add controller support to the android version of this game should not be a challenge from a programming standpoint even the linking of various functions to buttons is actually quite easy for input if the full apk can be opened up even going through manually there are only so many types of taps and button uses that need linking this has always been the breaking point on trying this game for me
1,i loved playing for a long time but after i lost my account two times it took months to get back and by then i started to fall out of the game the customer service was very unhelpful and overall was not a good experience not to mention the app took up so much space and everytime i had to update it was huge and a hassle
1,promising at launch just a cash grab in the end the exploration part is decent though short lasting and once it is done along the story if you can call that a story nothing but pointless grind awaits artefacts or abyss the two endgames making new characters and regions is all they care about since it is what works best for money and getting players to return gameplay no thanks elemental reaction are fun for a bit but all that matters is spamming skills and ults dodge is wanky
1,genshin impact crashes every time i try to play on my chromebook at about when compiling the shaders
1,all my progress was randomly deleted and i am not able to log back in to the same account
1,when i fight with abyss herald we will be reunited quest it got sudden lag restarted i tried several times to play the archon quest then also this problem
1,pay to win game the wish system is really bad and every new character powercreeps the other disgusting
1,not really friendly for mid or entry level smart phones you will encounter several visual glitches and sometimes crashes it would be cool if they fixed this issue but i do not think it will solved soon
1,basically unable to pass adventure rank ascension after updated to nov version image collide happens i need a solution to it
1,add the game to xbox and add controller support to android you are gate keeping a good game
1,i hate your game certain abilities would not work and my delicious goulash i made after the boar king quest to keep warm in dragonspine mountains did not work my characters still froze to death and i tried to get hoyoverse to help me out but they would not help or even care your game is the worst most non fun rpg i ever played you game company should never ever receive any good reviews nor funding
1,i can see why this game appeals to so many people giant vast beautiful open world a thousand exploration tactics and pretty character designs accompanied by a nice storyline my problem is that the game is so stingy that you barely get any currency the lack of endgame content boring character stories and most of all how long and bad the storyline is stretched out and executed its just boring now after three years i still only have six five stars
1,the game does not open after the new update version the screen stays white after opening the door and says that i am disconeccted
1,the game itself is good the quality the story the effects everything is to the top level but the biggest but is that the conversation is too much lengthy and there is no damn skip button like how can there not be a skip button to skip scenes i come to chill in the game after work for few minutes to an hour and then comes the lengthy dialogues which takes out more than of the time introduce a damn scene skip option not everyone wants to see the story some wants just to grind
1,the game itself is kinda good in terms of stuff to do ig but i am not gonna pay dollar a pull for a bunch of children and maybe a dude and then get stuck pulling nothing but common swords and pointless crafting items i like the storyline overall but there is a lot of stuff that does not really pace well in the story the music is pretty good though just wish there was a bit more a lot of times the music would just stop or be lowered because i am in the wild like what
1,poor user experience if the app is difficult to navigate has a confusing layout or is slow to load it can lead to frustration and a negative experience for the user lack of functionality if the app does not offer the features that users expect or need it can be seen as useless or irrelevant poor performance if the app crashes frequently or has other performance issues it can be frustrating for users
1,please make the artifact system like in honkai star rail at least let us choose the main stat i am always getting best substat with worst main stat
1,won my heart but the wish events really suscks i have reached adventure rank and yet have not got any five star character been trying all the ways to collect primo for what nothing
1,this game so bad they do the adds for nothing what is so fun about this trash infinite load crashing game horrible i would give this a zero star if could
1,why cannot i download full file from playstore this sucks cause in game download is too slow it took days to download the full file in game cause the normal speed kbps not even a single mbps but from playstore it would have took just minute cause download speed from it is mbps genshin sucks man
1,i had to download gigabyte to run the game and on my giga internet connection it still took me two days i came back after a while and it said gigabyte bruh i get megabyte update but b the entire game was a gig it is a big open world with good graphics so i get gigabyte but why do you have to download gigabyte more same world same story an update should megabyte mb gigabyte if it is big but gigabyte now the game is gigabyte and not only did i have to download it but my phone is almost full not to mention the lag even though i have g
1,used to be fun not anymore more interesting games are out there and they still manage to keep thier players entertained but just not this one
1,they never improved the game or added end game do not waste your time it will be fun for a couple months then you will get sick of it like everyone else
1,i was playing this game from the start and the game was amazing but now it requires megabyte gigabyte data to download just to play a game on a mobile please optimise it for mobiles or you well lose the players who love the games but do not have the space to download now my journey with genshin impact have reached its end until the game is again playable
1,love the game but hate the lack of controller support i play it on pc only because of this
1,game keeps getting bigger in every update it was already taking up gigabyte worth of space and now i got a gigabyte update this making it unplayable for me
1,hii can you fix the game because my old account is have more five star when i switch my account to the old account its stock and back in homescreen and switch in my new account it back in homescreen please fix it i love this game
1,developer refuses to communicate with customers bizarre technical limitations on android and pc compared to another platform
1,last year i jokingly renamed my wanderer ei as a joke thinking it would not let me but i was wrong and i just want to fix i feel like renaming him should be a permanent thing and just have a like day timer i just get so annoyed looking at the name ei please just make renaming him permanent thing for everyones sake
1,it cannot be open e ery time just show free up space in my phone already lots of space but still it cannot open after downloading what nonsense
1,i have downloaded now cannot play because of no space so i am going to free up some space and delete this rubbish game i cannot even start yours
1,sorry i deleted the game because first data it started to download was gigabyte and i know after that there will still be updates and all so if you wanna play this game you need to have a compulsory phone only for this game so a no go for me
1,game keeps crashing thank god i went through the whole download for two hours to have this happen it is junk
1,how come no controller support for android but ios does very unbias i will play again if they add controller support for android i might give five stars for that
1,a bad game and it needs a big space and waste of time i hope no one will play this awful
1,it is a fun game but as a free to play it is really hard to enjoy i tend to skip banners with how little primo they give out i log in everyday and do everything and still cannot roll a lot i still do not get notifications on when my resin caps artifact farming is awful been farming the same stuff for months and still have not found anything good i do not recommend this game to new players since it is not new player friendly you are so behind there is just so much to catch up on and you become gated
1,i loved this game but the trails in tianqiu quest ruined it because i cannot progress thurther and i am not at a high enough level to beat it i did not even know it would not let me cancel it please add a option to cancel quests so we can progress and if you are going to not do that at least give a clear warning to show you cannot progress
1,greedy company gatcha pack deals anni ads focus money allotment goals etc no endgame literally just gear farming simulator and waiting community generally horrid youtube twitter reddit gatcha sucks no balancing buffing just a pull these new character and be force to play a specific team in order to play a character you really like no cooperative activity for a mobile phone it is beyond garbage with its storage size playability bugs lag and visual
1,unplayable on phone it kicks me out every few minute even if i have enough storage it kicked me out right now in fact i barely finished one commission it is more suitable for pc or laptop
1,this game is annoying me imagine downloading a game it then asks you to input your email address and password you then take your time to create an email address and crack your brain to get an unguessable password you then come back to play your game you input your email stuff and go through the verification process it then shows you success but all of a sudden it tells you that your unquestionably accurate email data is in one way or another inaccurate and repeats it all the time
1,the game turned into a boring childrens attraction an uninteresting plot uninteresting dialogues that impossible to snap the only difficult content in the game is made more difficult not due to interesting mechanics but simply by increasing hp and damage this is a failure and i am very sad because my favorite game turned into a bright but uninteresting and boring childrens entertainment children have no money to contribute to the game i have it but i do not want it anymore
1,i love it you can do anything in here the only pain is that i have to kill monsters and find chests and i do not know where all the chest are the important thing is that i enjoy it i do not seem to find any bug or glitches so it is an amazing game nevermind i lost all my progress give it all back i deleted it cause it was to much then re installed it and it was gone
1,the reason for this one star is the resin system its so trash even for a gatcha game it blocks you from blitzkrieging the game yesz as it should but its too much of a how do i word it restriction because almost everything you need to upgrade and progress a character is locked behind it and all we get at max is not even five condensed resin you need more exp mats exp book boss drops etc and all we get is like hello at least make it or give out more fragile resins as reward
1,good story great graphics and beatiful artsyle is what i would say if they actually cared for theur mobile fanbase if you own anything less than an iphone then you have to endure through countless hours of lag and low quality polys not to mention the game is getting pay to win something that would maybe put my review to four stars is to add a skip button its not that hard
1,too much difficulty the opponents are so highly tough and it is so difficult to compete plus raising the adventure rank takes time and its ok but you keep a very tough challege at lv and we are stuck and unable to proceed further this game is certainly a nice game but it should not be this diffcult at least you can keep difficulty levels like easy med hard all in all a good game but is so frustrating when your opponents are so hard to be beat the level of toughness is so high fed up of the game
1,please fix dehya energy requirement and cooldown of skills i personally prefer dehyas elemental burst to be energy requirement and cooldown in terms of elemental skill i want her follow up damage with normal attack to have aligned in every normal attack not every second i hope my concern will be notice thank you
1,the new area is cool but nothing seems out of ordinary the new archon quest is super boring and there is no actions what so ever talking to npc all the time plus the new archon is annoying pick a fight with the traveler said she want to fight the traveler but instead talking the entire scene
1,trash game with rigged luck do not start playing if you are interested in the characters just watch clips of them on youtube not like you are ever going to roll the one you want also do not bother contacting support because in two years of playing they have literally never helped on a request even once
1,i get trash anniversary rewards you get one star rating fair enough honestly after all the time and money spent on a game you reward your player base with abysmally awaful rewards it would have been better if you did not celebrated the anniversary not that you did way to attract me players kudos
1,horrendous gacha rate and rigged to get a char at th pulls super prone to lose on rate of dropping artifact infested with def and def which rigged to upgrade def related substat when refine have a free time to add animation of party setup which is useless while basic qol like touch position adjusting or android gamepad support is nowhere to be found absurdly unforgivable nonsense wall of text and cutscene which is unskippable resin and extremely stingy rewards
1,genshin impact not launching mobile latest update my game is not opening after update it got stuck after starting door animation after that i should have to restart my device then only i can use my phone i tried all things like restarting my device restarting my game reinstalling the massive gigabyte game time now what i suppose to do help me out please as soon as possible it my humble request
1,it took two minute to download but when i got in most literaly it took four hours to load and then it crashed it crashed i had to do it all again
1,hoyoverse should fix their rng in artifact farming and resin system been farming artifacts for one month and only got two complete sets this is totally outrageous with the amount of resin capped artifact farming should not be this hard people will quit genshin because of the effort just to get the right artifact i do not recommend any new player for this game save yourself the time and enjoy life
1,great i got mail that game do not support powervr device from last one year well i do not understand how i was playing since than and now suddenly this update is crashing the game and still after editing my post twice you guys till do not answer how is it possible for me to play game for one years and suddenly its stop supporting
1,the game good overall but the fontaine update has made it near unplayable certain world quests make the game crash and not work anymore i cannot even load into the game since it crashes at the loading screen now
1,if the devs put even a fraction of the passion that the orchestra put into the soundtrack it would be a wonderful game alas terrible drop rates paired with repetitive and dull combat along with an open world that is somehow both packed with missable collectibles and terribly empty at the same time just listen to the soundtrack and you will walk away much happier than if you played it if nothing else avoid playing it so you do not have to spend hours wishing you could strangle paimon
1,yeah so space required has exponentially increased by a lot not an issue because i do not play this anymore as to why gameplay is repetitive and dull completely randomized stats for artifacts makes it even more so case and point gameplay is next to non existant exploration fine good graphics but it is not everyones cup of tea currency battlepass already bad gacha not too bad then comes the primo too much effort and overpriced for what a cute hot anime waifu just buy a fig
1,i cannot open my genshin anymore because everytime i got in loading in entrance it keep crashing the screen and will stop loading please fix it it is been week i never play the genshin there is an issue in the entrance loading it keep stock mine and other players please fix it right away
1,this game has the best graphics and storyline out there but the problem is how little they care about their players they organise multiple web events and in game events but they only give you like wishes which is extremely low also the adventure rank rewards are pathetic on reaching the max adventure rank they give a standard wish which is mostly useless and they give primo which cannot even be converted to a single fate the game just wants moneyandmoreplayer gives nothing to its player
1,boring and repetitive most characters tend to be relatively uninteresting the actually gacha system to gain new characters is you may as well not even try to roll you will not be able to receive a single character without spending real world money let alone a new weapon that makes it worth the effort the only thing it really has going for it is to act as a boredom killer for a few moments before you put it down and forget it exists again
1,it says i have a lot of storage on my tablet when i barely have any games on there i tried deleting pictures and some games i cannot delete everything on there because it says i cannot
1,good game but the pity system is very hard for a free to playplayer i mean is pity and is hard pity also the resin regeneration is vey sloww
1,i have deleted everything off my phone and still insufficient memory wonderful screw your commercials on facebook report report
1,i could not even play it it takes up too much space i really wanna play please fix this asap please and thank you
1,this game has the worst cs ever guys be sure to keep your account safe some random russian dude hacked my account and no matter what i do the cs is just useless my years of play gone in seconds tried twice but the cs is just useless third class there is no protection whatsoever if you get into any situation like this edit after like trying for times in a row i finally got my account back
1,is not it too much now that the odds of rolling artifacts in at least decent are also not getting rolled i feel like this game is bullying me or something like why am i getting good artifact at beginning and then suddenly when you roll all goes in useless stats like def and def for me this two are not leaving me at all they really need to increase the odds of getting at least please at least some decent rolls possibility please again
1,does not make me go in the quality sucks when i am in the game it kicks me out my internet connection is good and my gigabyte is good but why does it kick me out so very not cool and makes me pissed off
1,only giving it one star because i cannot get on the game i built a pc and played genshin impact i wanted to play it on my phone as well but everytime i try to log on the app it says success then account or password error i can confirm my login info is not incorrect because it works logging in on my pc and the website on my phone except this app whenever or if this problem gets fixed i will change to five stars
1,game is pretty good but some quest in the game is really hard even after watching video on youtube that really annoying
1,i would give it five stars but i have not played it and if i wanted too i would not be able to play it because every device i have had it said that i had insufficient storage space even though it is the first thing i download i am just trying to play a game i have been dreaming of playing but that will not happen anytime soon
1,my phone space is gigabyte ram but they said download data is gigabyte how this possible this i cannot play this game but i really want to play this game can you solve this problem
1,update like you asked i would not give it one star i uninstalled it waited then checked my data and storage i have plenty so there is no reason after i connect to one of three ways and agree to the terms privacy that it should not finish but it does not i took a screenshot of the error but there is not a way to upload it here original review basically from the time i downloaded it it keeps saying there is not enough room to do the updates i have gigabyte left so how is that not enough room
1,please fix your game there is a bug for some devices where you can not see damage numbers ice or grass it is very annoying and stupid
1,i have been locked out for a year we have tried everything it is my favorite game and i cannot even play it
1,it is a good game but there is terrible development and updates for example when you first install the game from googleplay you have to download gigabyte worth of data then verify the integrity of files then compile shaders and so on and so forth i mean come on what is going on here the developers really need to rethink the startup process and the size of this game firstimers will be discouraged and likely uninstall the game before they even get to try it
1,game not letting me play do to storage after i deleted almost all my apps and a error code pops up code how much storage do i need
1,the content graphic event character story and even the background music also good but almost three years the capped at resin and never increase and i do not know what the point of maintaining resin for almost three years
1,i am pretty upset i came back to the game after i played it when it released and now i have lost all progress on my account everything i spent money on is gone what the hell happened
1,do not bother with this game there is a massive lack of controler support the servers seem to be a bit unstable random disconnections at peak hours and all around this game just is not it i mean cool i grind i fight i do quests gets a little repetitive as time goes on like the same quests are being repeated but in a different area just do yourself a favor skip this one save that extra hour or two of your life
1,i have spent a lot of time downloading additional data then a lot of time verifying the downloaded data then some more time preparing to start and at the end when i hit begin it just gives me an error problem loading game data log in again needless to say this is extremely frustrating i have deleted it after a few restarts and tries to start clean i think one star is a lot for something that does not even start for support purposes the phone is huawei mate pro with installed gms
1,it is difficult to make a passwords and username because it always says error
1,takes up a lot of space but love the story and gameplay
1,please no more acsension quests it is way too hard now either put the third one to recommended level seventy or no ruin guards or i quit
1,will not open i have cleared all the data i can and it still will not install the information so i am deleting this game
1,i download this game resources which is eight five gigabytes after all my data and time waste it is going to download again whole eight five gigabytes again
1,the spanish translation is horribly vulgar full of misspellings and grammar mistakes
1,how is it possible that in twenty twenty three this game does not have controller support but ios does please explain that one
1,great game would give five if it had controller support on android
1,an i supposed to wait through the first cutsean because i cannot make an account it only says login to an account for this reason and probably no help i gave this game a star review
1,the latest events are all very bad and boring especially the samples event many players did not know it was a daily event
1,my data is on full signal and i cannot log in my account and the screen is still loading
1,the download takes way too long i could not even play the game since my phone died first before the download was done
1,i have been waiting for years for controller support in this android game when will the controller support be available
1,could not even play it because it said i needed more space even after uninstalling my biggest app
1,it lets me install it but will not let me play it it keeps saying insufficient memory to download resources
1,honestly its just a gyatt game too much skibidi toilet references and the new cameraman they added was trash including all the others from skibidi verse delete this game now its not worth the fanum tax
1,i download this game but it cannot download the resources i am almost delete all of my important detail fix this
1,got worst account ever bad artifact up to ninety nine percent and guaranted one hundred percent high pity and lose every single banner ascend and talent got so minimum nothing any good at my account
1,years later this game still got no controller support while ios already got four months after the game released at this moment might as well google deleted this game from this store because it does not caters to the demographic android users
1,after so many years they still cannot be bothered to add controller support ridiculous
1,gave this app one store because this app keep making us log into this app which we really do not have to other games do not make us do this
1,all the designs are getting boring like keep honkai out of this half the designs in that game are mid be original babes
1,this is a brand new device and it keeps telling me about insufferable storage like what am i supposed to do this device brand new
1,give controller support to android i have started then instantly stopped playing
1,i have more than double the required space yet will not let me download the update and play
1,the auto camera suck bad they did better with lag but i had to use all lowest graphic
1,i already downloaded my resources but what is this when i open the app it start downloading the resources again which is i already downloaded it please fix this problem
1,game do not work i have forty eight gigabyte free uninstalled it reinstalled it times still tells me insufficient storage
1,mini games and more mini games you cannot even use your characters you pulled zero qol patches or improvents since launch same formula every expansion
1,my honest review this game has excessive ads ping always bugging even though the connection is fast always face glitching in domain hoyoverse please fix it it is too much for me
1,since four update is here but the screen still crashed and cannot login to play it of softlocked in the underwater cave
1,been playing this games for years and now i cannot even play anymore i have friends with the newest iphone who cannot even download this game because of how much storage it takes i have deleted literally everything off my phone and still cannot even download much less run it you need to fix your game
1,it is fun very fun but the camera keeps moving very very slowly i cannot really move it when i got my first character it will not let me move the character only the screen can be moved uninstalled
1,the puzles are horrible i do not understand how anyone finds them out by themself of has fun doing it they are awful every time i try it i get frustrated and start crying so i have to look it up every time and i am supposedly smart so
1,the game is great really fun controls are great really fun story and conversations could improve a bit do not get me wrong they are not bad but could improve the only problem i have and i believe it is a problem worth of star review is that you cannot take your save from one server to another i moved to a different country and now the game has become unplayable i do not really care about lag the problem is i keep getting disconnected it is incredibly annoying please solve this
1,the game is amazing except that it keeps on lagging the faces the ground characters buildings and items would disappear the first time i saw the dragon the whole time in the cut scene it was just lagging so much even when i fought it i could not even see anything on the screen anymore but i managed so the problem is either my phone or the game and i am using an oppo
1,hi there so it always says that i have insufficient storage even though i have around ten gigabyte of storage free i understand that genshin impact is a big game but i did not think that it would take so much storage it is a popular game and of course i wanted to try too i have been trying since last year but its still in vain if there are any way that i could play this i would do it as i really really want to play it that is all thank you
1,really love this but when i log in the geo one take forever to log in i worries so much that one day in my school i fainted so if you want me to not worry then please fix genshin impact thank you
1,i cannot even play the game it is a bummer because it seems like a fun game
1,maybe a good game but as a muslim i think there are many elements of shirk worshipping statue and in the storyline the revealing scenes of characters before playing this game and being addicted please learn if it is against your religion or not
1,this game suck i cannot play be because the loading is so long it gave hours to load
1,when i first played this i believe in the game was so laggy and kept crashing and now i cannot even play it since it keeps saying i do not have enough space i have already deleted a bunch of apps and even cleared a bunch of storage but it keeps saying the same thing and it is annoying and really disappointing since i wanted to play this game
1,i have not played yet because the loading thing is annoying and it keep saying error and i cannot play the game anymore i kept redoawnloading and it does not work too i deleted some of my important apps just for the error to go away and it does not work too and i spend my five hours waiting and guess what it does not worked either if you remove the loading thing and the error thing so many people can rate higher and does not have to wait anymore
1,always showing server error even though i have good internet connection
1,no controller support on android uninstalling
1,worst game ever it will not let me play and they wonder why people are unstalling genshin impact
1,i tried to download i deleted so much stuff this phone is not even like years old i have had it for like three weeks and genshin is too big looks fun but i do not think i will ever be able to play it i deleted a bunch of stuff to the point i had like gigabyte of space left still not enough there is not much else i can delete so unless genshin is somehow made to be smaller a lot of people will not be able to play
1,this game sucks it is cringe and worst of all there is a character with a gun the characters talk more than my grandma when i mention something about school which is to say a lot also this game is like an gigabyte download that is all my remaining phone storage and there is too much stuff when i played i got overwhelmed by the sheer amount of stuff on the hud so i hate this game if you want a better game go download clash royale
1,this game has to be in xbox asap it is taking up gigabytes of my storage
1,so this game is great on pc or playstation that is on pc i can install it on whatever drive i want and it will run and download to that drive fine i got an sd card specifically for this game to have it on my phone but it simply will not download its resources to the sd card when i move the app over games great but if you do not have the space on internal storage you do not have the space period
1,no controller support despite every other version having it
1,no controller support because of that i stopped playing the game is unplayable otherwise i cannot barely even see the screen because of all the buttons along with my hands them the screen gets filthy because of using my fingers which just adds to the annoyance deserves a one star rating would deserve five stars if there was controller support
1,star for changing the fontaine archon quest ending furina should have had it
1,no matter how much space i have on my sd card genshin keeps giving me message i transfer genshin to my sd card yet i still lack space
1,would not recommend this game reached level adventurer level unlocked almost all the statues of seven all of the upper half of the waypoint teleports stations along with one third of the lower half ones and had advanced my main character to point she was not a wind type character anymore and transformed into a geo type fighter also had unlocked two ice characters an adorable panda suit dressed girl that could use wind attacks and others todays update stole my entire progress so had to start ovr
1,game looks best looks it deserves five stars but it takes too time to load even in higher configuration device mobile dimensity ram gigabyte internal gigabyte out of gigabyte free it takes too many time i am disappointed otherwise loading time music is appreciated i expect permanent solution excluding uninstall
1,you false advertise an archon keeping us excited and wanting to still take our money while never even giving us hydro archon in first place shame on you
1,controls are extremely clumsily designed the directions should be closer to left edge of screen instead of the middle navigating like climbing etc is not possible with current controls at all a lot of luck is required just not to fall and die next game if you like to tap fifty times through copied and pasted bad lines every time you do a quest consider yourself warned
1,put some proper representation my dark skin sisters are begging for just an ounce of melanin a turning dial of pixel color absolutely unplayable characters blend in with the sky and glow brighter than white
1,i love this game but i cannot wait to play the download resource are so big and it takes two days to complete the resources please i need to play already or i will be your basher instead of a fav game
1,security is so strict i cannot even log ini am sick of proving thati am me gave up playing this and uninstalled
1,the game would not load it just will not every time i join i it just will not loading it says i have no storage
1,all of a sudden my screen is blacking out over and over galaxy ultra
1,been playing for years however both on mobile and laptop the two devices i played on both lack the storage to unzip the game files it is especially annoying because i have enough storage for the game itself just unzipping the files requires a insane amount of storage i can respect genshin is a good game but its storage problems is why people including me and my friends can no longer play and is only gonna get worse in the future shame about all the money i have spent on this too
1,stuck at the log in whatever way to log in i choose it does not work
1,i think the game is stupid cause it has you have to enter a password and i hate it because i cannot do that because i do not have one that works so i think the game is stupid i think that should be taken out of the game
1,i deleted most of my games just for it to say not enough space i even deleted one of my favorite games and i had a lot of progress on the same game so do not download it
1,honestly do not get this game on mobile or pc they are money crazed i spent to get wriothesley still did not get him i got thoma four times in a row then i got dori two times in a row i have grinded as hard as i can since wriothesley came out and guess what still do not own wriothesley you cannot just straight up pay for a character they force you to gamble it is honestly a huge waste of time this sort of thing happens every single time i play this game it is not worth the time or effort
1,before four i can play the game but now every time i log in the start up screen begins lagging and turns my screen black and my phone could handle the game pretty well please fix this bug hoyoverse
1,very high storage capacity required just what the helli am only playing lowest graphics it would be nice if there is an option to pick and download the graphics i preferred then problem solve it might be only a slight decrease but it really is helpful if there is so i will just keep playing toram
1,i cannot play the game keep saying insufficient storage space to try again later i keep trying nothing
1,this game is extremely big for a regular phone to handle the data this games requires you to download is otherworldly insane if your going to keep adding more stuff to the game then you have to cut losses because at this point just make it a just console and pc game hell i could not even play the game on my new phone without it overheating while downloading in the menu and then it crashed afterwards because of the animation the game is already on console but please remove the exclusion to ps
1,we needed controller support for androids too android users are more than apple so y not controller support for android
1,please optimise the game for nothing phone two it is lagging and overheating
1,unity game always has poor optimization on android please optimize the game properly
1,i love this game on pc but the app sucks i tried downloading it on my micro sd card and halfway through my in game download it crashed the app glitched out and refused to open and my sd card got corrupted and i lost all the files that were on it unless you have a really high end phone i do not recommend even trying to download it just get a pc or playstation instead
1,how to fix the insufficient storage space problem even if a have a lot of storage for it
1,ok so i stopped playing genshin for a bit and when i try to log in it is telling me insufficient storage space it was working a month ago like what the hll do you want now i cannot even log in to my account at all either wow thanks for the welcome back gift hoyoverse src
1,this game is in my top three most played games of all time i have over total hours in game i quit playing consistently one year ago as someone who only spent roughly dollars on the game the grind was a massive issue though my main gripe with this is how repetitive it is every update every optimized five star every domain all start to feel the same and it takes so long to realize yet you still march on completely addicted to the stale grind this is the worst game i have ever played
1,it will not let me join it keeps saying inefficient storage and i have tried everything and it will not let me
1,game is fun but hoyoverse did dehya dirty she is so bad so very very bad add controller support
1,fun game but there is no reason to have such a big download for resources takes to long and is a joke ridiculous
1,its a good game but the storage capacity it takes is not really that good people are quiting because of the storage issue i hope you guys can do something about it
1,i ended up downloading it thanks to youtube shorts and i was enjoying it for a bit but after a week and a half the missions it started giving me were impossible to do without leveling up and ascending characters and this was not the main quests these were the daily missions from the guild which i feel like i should be able to grind my lower level characters with for free exp instead of having to use the books uninstalled
1,please hoyo help me its still needs space i have been wanting to play this game for a long time
1,just got back but the game seriously large gigabyte is enough but additional gigabyte for four update ugh really sorry i rather play honkai star rail i think genshin only great if you play on pc
1,cannot even install the first update to start playing even after deleting a ton of stuff
1,lacks controller support for android please add controller support for android and i will change this to five stars
1,the icon for profile picture the character is too close please bring back the old one because it is better
1,love the game rewards desperately need to be fixed
1,the game is rubbish just grinding and not getting characters
1,cannot support controller on android mihoyo loves apple one star thank you
1,i aint paying for new exclusive gimmicks that will become obsolete in a few patches
1,always losing the and the rewards are always low
1,there are too many things to learn and it is very overwhelming would rate stars if i could
1,not goodi am waiting to long i did not even play yet cause the resources are still loading
1,the game is good itself but what i hate is the game size like can you even put gigabyte on a fricking little phone please please developers release a lite version editi am sorry for making this stupid review but i got a better phone now so yay
1,good game and nice environment i always accidently hit attack or use skill when try move screen
1,the game was not opening and kept saying insuffient storage even though i have nine gigabyte left
1,it demands so much space and it will not install on my micro sd card no matter permissions
1,im disappointed i installed this game one day excitedly because on my old tablet it did not show up on the play store because my device was not compatible i install it on my new tablet to find it takes up a lot of storage was not my major problem but that it takes forever to load then when it finishes and goes into the opening scene the audio is so glitchy and so is the video i hope to see this become better in the future so disappointed
1,only one cause it is always the insufficient storage but i have enough storage now my scaramouche cannot be played anymore
1,third anniversary but still no gamepad support for android shame
1,fix your game in my expirence the game did not show damage text icannot se when the water is frozen and ican even see fk grass two years of waiting for an update to fix it fk you
1,cannot even play the game every time it says is need space and i lose all of my games and is steel says the same thing
1,i will only rate full stars when it gives me tome of eternal flow this is not luck anymore it is favoritism why do other people get early pity at gacha and i am always hard pity you all have favorites
1,it is a good app but after i installed it my father left me to tom nairda please come back dad your child misses you
1,my previous review was five stars but since i have learned that ios has controller support while android users have been left out of the for literally no legitimate reason my review will remain a single star it is straight up discrimination
1,the game keeps telling me not enough storage and i deleted almost every game and photo and it says the same thing ya uninstalling
1,never got to play kept saying i needed more memory to download files have plenty of memory available
1,i love this game but have to make it one star as its nearly impossible to play on mobile the size of the game is outrageous and gets worse with each update i have started this game three times on three different newer devices and each time within six months i was unable to continue playing because of new updates and download sizes go play it on a decent computer and it will be a ton of fun while still taking up too many resources devs are lazy and think bigger means better
1,in recent updates the game is become too much laggy it is unplayable very disappointed
1,this game is fantastic but there are very network issues
1,i like this game but the storage is so big can i just play genshin impact its been six or nine days did not play genshin impact i just miss playing this so please can you low storage
1,no android controller support after three years while ios users basiczlly had it on launch
1,okay let me be honest i have never played this game but i wanted to and i downloaded it but every time i open the app and try to play you do not have enough storage message pops up i cleared my storage as much as i could which was to about eight one gigabyte and it still would not work i rated one star because i really wanted to play and i could not
1,it is horrible the gameplay the graphics and the people are worst out of it all they are all always talking about lgbtq stuff wheni am just tryna play like bro
1,it is super annoying when i see the indifference storage when i only have five games please fix it
1,this game has been hit with several hacker waves and it feels bad when peoples account are getting stolen sold or trashed by hackers plus even after getting your account back from the lackluster customer support there is no account roll back so you can say bye to all those five star weapons you pulled if the hacker fodders it to another weapon which is pretty dumbi am at that point of committing suicide after having two years of investment gone after getting my account back
1,worst game needs lots of space to download and play the the game please do not waste your time
1,too hard to make exploration too low primo as rewards
1,first thing it demands is an online account how does no sound terrible first impression uninstalling
1,does this game ever stop downloading hour in and i just closed it out never got to the game itself
1,long time star rail player looking for a adventure was very excited to play this on my brand new high end tablet that was finally powerful enough to play this game at decent settings downloaded the couple dozen gigabytes of patches and assets booted the game up and worked through the tutorial quest holding the ten tablet awkwardly until the settings menu and options were finally available connected my bluetooth controller no controller support how are you supposed to play on a tablet
1,my account disappeared out of nowhere for the second time i tried to contact the support but they are not replying this is just outrageous
1,no hope for genshit team boring except battling exploring when not fully explored
1,why does the game do not log in when i enter it always says failed network please go and fix it
1,i think genshin impact is a great game with beautiful visuals and fun gameplay mechanics however the game is very pay to play even if it tries hard not to seem that way getting a five stars requries way too much money even more depending on whether your actually winning your or not and it just ruins the whole experience
1,it takes so long to load it took me more than one hour an minute and ita still loading its not even close and i am using nanay cellphone
1,literally cannot log in connection times out after the door animation
1,the game is overall the best mobile game i have ever played but bruh what is this rewards honkai star rail is rocking with rewards but what about you
1,i deleted half of my entire phone and the game is still saying there is not enough storage very bad
1,why is this game not working to my phone it keeps disconnecting i deleted all my videos and apps just to download this app
1,pulls lost at and guarantee at giving nothing to free two play players
1,this game is awful cannot even play it after nearly deleting everything on my phone with gigabyte of space free and still will not let me download it says i need more space it is garbage
1,genshin impact has a lot of pros like an interesting combat system or a well designed world and lore unfortunately it is a potemkin village of a game designed to rope you in with addictive gameplay loops before you realize just how many problems it has there is no permanent endgame content so if you log in daily you will spend most of your time waiting for things to improve you experience the game through characters but character variety is low and characters are poorly balanced
1,this game sucks when it comes to what really player needs and also a scumbag company who earns a lot from their players but does not give back their gratitude to them giving so little that is a slap to the face on their beloved players and customers
1,i cannot even play it because the loading screen takes forever i literally looked at it for an hour and it was only at i do not recommend
1,bad gacha experience lost seven in a row so much better gacha games out there repetitive endless grind for artifacts and events becomes more and more of a chore storyline awesome plot but terrible storytelling telling a story through unskippable and long cutscenes is only boring quitted about a year ago interesting new content but i am not buying it
1,i had said quit genshin if you are not invested into their story fontaine in four is just super boring but they introduced new mechanic ousia pneumia to make all your old characters useless especially in abyss worst power creeping ever
1,i deleted all my apps because this is my old device but everytime i tried to get in it told me i did not have any storage i deleted all the apps i was aloud to delete but it still will not let me play i regret this a lot
1,it will not even start it closes the time the geo symbol starts loading i was able to play on playstation but i currently do not have access to one and everytime i open it here it closes
1,just played the game for two days and now getting an error unable to connect to server tried with all the servers which are provided
1,stale gameplay boring events which do not have anything to do with the main gameplay bad story good lore unskipable cutscenes a lot of time is just reading mindless redundant text horrible gacha and the worst of all ungrateful to players
1,why your company so falling love with def all stat but just def will more change to upgrade dud hard pity lose def hard pity lose def i am top up no more and waiting for your competitors and move on nvm right missing one player adventure rank will not effected your income hoyotod
1,okay i am adventure rank now and there is nothing to do in this game they refuse to add more end game content no skins no resin absolutely boring and nothing to do i deleted the game totady because of that community is so wholesome i had so many friends yeah it is sad i will come back when they add more permanent end game content thank you for the good memories
1,still no controller support on android even though android has supported controller longer then ios i want to like this game but touch controls suck and no controller support is unacceptable
1,im uninstalling immediately i have been playing for a long time and honestly i love the game but it is not worth paying you have made it incompatible with most phone versions and it is unfair i loved this game now i hate the entire company
1,where is the controller support i do not play games with dedicated on screen controls its too unresponsive and finicky this should have already been implemented as of v it is still missing this critical feature not excusable given that many games have controller support nowadays bottom of the barrel tier port play it on pc
1,terrible i kept on deleting as many apps and pictures even up to having free gigabyte of storage just to encounter a insufficient storage space error fix this bug
1,the worst installation process it will not install updates in the background so you are forced to do not hing while it installs an initial update then again while it updates shaders honestly i gave up and uninstalled before even playing the game because the installation process is so tedious
1,good overall but resin is really turning me off along with bad rates it got boring real quick do not get me wrong its a great game but they need to remove or make the resin system better this is why i am leaving it at three stars its a great game but it kinda got boring for me real quick used to play it everyday and i am adventure rank bad rates is fine for me but the resin just prevent me from grinding for my character
1,as soon as i started playing this game i gained pounds in weight got a divorce got kicked out of my apartment and stopped touching grass as soon as i uninstalled the game i magically became fit wife came back and i was given a penthouse for free coincidence i think not
1,not on any console i own after a long download my pc cannot run it so i go and after a second long download on android i find out there is no controller support you do not want me to play your game fine i give up i will not play it
1,crashes alot like ifyou are lucky it goes ten minute without crashing and the cherry on top is the absolute worst customer care services my account got hacked and instead of resolving the issue they will just keep you going in loops and how easy is it for hackers to just hijack your account without any problems they do not even need access to your email they can just simply change the damn thing without any problems i play other games too but none have such flawed security measures
1,after around eight months of playing i started to get fed up with the over grinding this game mandates the limited resin also aggravates the suffering edit still doing the dailies nothing wrong with that edit mihoyo has been somewhat generous with the primo lately which is really good edit most of my complaints in genshin have been fixed in honkai sr sadly genshin did not get the same treatment edit finallyi am done with the game
1,i love this game so muchi am just extreamly upset i do not know if anyone else is having this problem but i had not played in a bit and when i logged in it was like my whole account was reseti am level one and i do not know what to do
1,we returned back as the same rewards for the last year the game has completed two years and they give the same rewards it is shame on you i am giving you one star like your rewards for two years
1,i found the game incredibly frustrating due to its excessive difficulty in exploration it felt like a constant uphill battle and the rewards were minimal if any it made me lose interest quickly and i could not enjoy the gameplay because of how unrewarding it was
1,nothing just very boring lately nothing exciting even new updates i know you guys work hard but instead of working hard why not try change instead listen to players problems be more generous etc
1,okay hoyo lets get this straight for the span of less than a year star rail as gotten so much more content and improvements compared to almost four years of what we have gotten for genshin you have not been fair to the fiathful community of this game
1,a great game to get lost in for hours love how i can just chill at home and play this on the playstation then go on the road and pick up right where i left off on my phone
1,odd cannot download resources as it keeps saying i have insufficent storage to which i have more than enough for download shame was looking forward to playing but cannot pity
1,yeah not gonna take up giga of space thanks unbelievable never heard of such a game that would take that amount of space on your device wow then the developers send me a reply saying if you have any problems with our game to email them seriously like no not a problem just stating a fact the game is huge and takes up so much space on a device you would have to delete everything off your phone just to play it lmao and also developers use bots to leave reviews unreal
1,do you now why i give you one star it is easy because your game and the system all the people want to enjoy your game but please fix all the problem issues like crashing in the devices all the people trying to enjoy the game but you did not fix the problem please genshin impact make this smooth to be playing this app
1,bad game for only one reason and that is this game does not have skipable dialogues scenes mechanics and because of that it has become a tiring and boring game that you would have to wait til the cringy long dialogues scenes to finish some players only the game for the game and not for the story
1,geez the devs acknowledge multiple complaints a the lack physical controls yet they still have not implemented that qol feature whats the point in says we appreciate and take feedback into consideration ifyou are not going to ever address it it is massively strange to design a well rounded game but be unable to program controller support
1,i downloaded this game today but on the home screen of the game it makes me so mad because when i try to enter the game it said i had insufficient storage space even though i uninstalled some apps i do not use anymore and deleted some stuff in my gallery the game still will not let me in please fix the storage problem thing and maybe i will give a higher rating thanks
1,a massive bug appeared when trying to complete the meka meka melee event i thought it was a problem with the quest but no an entire underwater region near fontaine is inaccessible the one near the underwater library my game glitches everytime i try to complete that section and when i tried exploring it the app crashed and forcefully kicked me out i cannot log into the game since i am locked at the glitch sectioni am reinstalling the game right now but if it fails to correct anythingi am out
1,i have opened and played well but charector stuck somewhere and game crash and now i try to open loading but every time to crash please solve the problem
1,good game but cannot enter it for some reason i always get stuck on half geo simble and when i get to full geo it just turns into half geo and then crashes the game is fantastic i have been playing it for one year i just wish they fix this problem i have complained but still no fix if it is not compatible to my phone then please tell what phones it supports
1,i have been playing genshin for four months but this is the first time that it crashed my genshin started crashing since the fountain update now it is not just crashing device will even go black screen and suddenly turn off please fix it
1,do not download what garbage the login process is totally screwed up i created login confirmed my email and never did manage to get in i kept getting errors and asked if i forgot my password i did not i just created it i tried to get in again and their numbered confirm would not even fully display uninstalled not worth it
1,emm after all the ads i hv been bombarded with on all the social platforms i am on i download it because now you see i am actially interested after download i see a cool looking loading screen but there is always a pop up in game that tells me check your internet connection error meanwhile i just mamaged to download it with the same internet router so i rated it one staras a way of sending complaints to the devs of the game
1,it is not in anyway ok at player with player you have no real way to play an open world mmorpg because they keep you separated unless you play in select spots
1,now they make a childe re rerun while there are a lot of characters that people want and are waiting for their first rerun they are asking for it in short ungrateful and greed af update game is like three years old by now and still no free five while star rail launched with one
1,installed onto a gigabyte sd card still insufficient memory this update is a scheme to gain access to your desktop computers after saturating after years of access to mobiles beware
1,cannot get into the game for some reason tried restarting device clearing cache and data redownload and reinstall problem still persists
1,i like the game it is perfect but my major issue is that when i open genshin my phone gets frozen then gets a black out and i almost lost my phone from the black out my phone can handle genshin i have gigabyte and gigabyte ram i do not know why my genshin keeps getting frozen and black out guys please fix this i want to play in the new fontaine map please i am begging you
1,cannot even play i keep seeing the game pop up and i try to play but like how much space does it take it just keeps telling me i do not have enough storage
1,i have deleted and deleted apps in materials from both my tablet and my phone cleared cache data and even moved ganshin to my sd card and it keeps giving me the insufficient space whats the point of having a mobile game that playstations worth of storage i used to be able to play this game on my phone
1,it was good at first with outstanding beauty and incredible atmosphere change but now it is impossible for me to even play it it will crash as soon as it loads
1,i like the game but the insufficent storage is just unacceptable it is literally taking out are storage and i am not going to rate it five stars unless they remove the insufficent storage and i cannot even play it i really want to play it but this game is nothing but just taking away our storage
1,it is a star game but when you try to log in it says insufficient storage even though you have plenty of storage when they fix this i will write a five star review up until then i cannot play it
1,i did not have such a great experience every time i try to log in and say i did not have enough free space had to lay the whole bunch of apps or try to play and it still did not want again
1,would love to get into it more but i was told there is no controller support on android any game melting my phone this much just to run it can afford to let me use a bluetooth controller
1,lazy team lazy repeated characters designs and story you can really do something different butyou are lazy even so player base supports this game and you does not appropriately reward them for it
1,listen again i understand that this is a huge game but do you seriously think thati am going to uninstall all of my files just to play a game that i do not even enjoy that much anymorei am not sure if you even read any reviews buti am going to write this anyways if your game cannot be played on such weak devices that do not have an unlimited amount of space then move it to pc console only and do not you even dare to write back with sorry but you need more space go fix your game
1,cannot even play it it is a mobile game that takes three gigabyte to even start up there is many phones that do not even have this storage compatibility
1,i decided to quit for a while but was planning to comeback when i tried to log in in one of my account i have noticed that it just kept loading already sent an email regarding this matter but i did not receive any reply
1,please provide better payment options for hybrid players i started on mobile after some time i noved to³ pc because my phone no longer can support it will not allow me to topup my battlepass on pc
1,its a childs game and very boring there is no real skill involved and utterly pointless missions and storyline at least do something for the adults as we are the ones who have the money not the kids
1,i like the graphics very much but the time it takes to load is just unbelievable play if you are a very patient person
1,the world quest line is very long not interesting and very childish stop with this kind of quest you guys made the quest bored since genshin started the only quest i love is archon quest and please stop with your stupid puzle we come here to slash monster not thinking outside the box for three hours of gameplay change your type of content
1,i downloaded the game cool went on game good went to register great put in email awesome go to verification code click on it great open foto read okay i see the top peace is cut off no problem read on it says select in follow order okay i do please try again how can i register with a half cut away verification pictures if the blady sequence of the correct order is cut of i tried everything restarting reinstalledi am also a game developer i and do i get my giga data i buy wit money not free or wifi
1,the game mechanics as well as characters and skills are excellent that is why it is only natural for it to require high storage which is a very great downside of the game in my opinion this game is for rich ones only who can afford high end phones i think it needs some focus on its storage consumption also
1,dogshit game your stuck with the same characters always doing the same thing over and over no variability and the massive storage space for the game is a waste space and time better games out there
1,i downloaded this game thinking it was just a fun adventure combat game upon it being installed i created an account and tried to start playing although each time i tried to play it i would get a message saying insufficient storage i just brushed it off and decided to delete a few of my games thinking that would fix it but it did not i ended up deleting almost half of my apps and still got that messate i personally think it takes up too much storage space for a game
1,the gameplay was awesome everything was good sadly i would say that genshin is a perfect example of a game that is good but does not age well due to lack of proper competition
1,i just downloaded it to see what all the fuss was about after registering and logging in i tapped to begin but it said insufficient storage space even though there is gigabyte space available in my mobile if i could have opened and played it i am sure i would give five stars please help me i do not know what to do thank you edit i have already downloaded the latest version but it is still showing error and not letting me play
1,i have loved genshin for so long and still do but now with the recent updatei am unable to play it is ten gigabyte for me on my mobile device and i find it quite ridiculous to me it seems as if hoyoverse does not care about it is mobile players
1,this game sucks a lot of updates expensive items and also it consumes a lot of space to your storage i do not recommend this game fix the bugs and the laggings you mornon developer tf
1,they are really stingy and they do not give the free to play players enough rewards it is hard to have a good account without paying you can see people are getting your fav character and its weapon and maybe some cons when you are worry to lose the and knowing if you lose it you cannot get the character because the only way to get primo are just missions and missions and after your hard working you will not even have a primo to make a single wish the ways to get primo are limited please treat your players better
1,all this game wants is your money you can spend all day and every day on this game and still not be able to get the character you want its either you save money or slave yourself away to this game and its honestly trash
1,the overwhelming app size has lead to it being useless for mobile devices ober gigabyte of storage space even for those parts which are not even played anymore
1,pls fix the code it is my favourite game but i do not have enough space can you make is megabyte for android nothing is working i have tried everything i can to play my favourite game genshin impact please fix this error code
1,it always crashes everytime i wanted to enter the game hoyoverse please fix the crashing problem i could not play the game anymore for two days
1,really like i deleted half of my photos and half of my apps and it still did not let me in i thought this game was going to be fun but no like is there something wrong with this app or what i might as well delete this game because what is a game when it does not even let you play when you all fix that i will probably install it again but like
1,the game takes up too much storage as a person who used to play when it was a lot smaller it is rather disappointing to not be able to play this game on my mobile device anymore
1,genshin impact is a game that has led to countless hours of gameplay for me and has unfortunately contributed to my unhealthy lifestyle playing genshin has become a bad habit that i desperately need to break the game is highly addictive and has led to me spending way too much time sitting around playing it which has taken a toll on my health as a result i have gained a significant amount of weight since i started playing the game and my physical health is suffering greatly i have neglec
1,terrible they make you work for so little for the quests and characters they also do not give you enough context about the quest which leaves me personally not knowing what to do
1,did not even play i have the room and it will not work saying there is not enough storage i have gotten an sd card and transferred all i could checked the version and everything still upsetting
1,it is a really huge game and gets boring day by day it is a pay to win game and really frustrates out if you are alone and playing without use of money just for its graphics it is not worth it you can expect better games in low storage and good story
1,i uninstalled multiple apps restarted my phone and i am reinstalling it at the moment but it kept showing error code edit reinstalled still showing error code i have eight gigabyte of storage
1,i did not even play the game it required an giga update to be able to play that is unreasonable and i bet a good chunk of that has nothing to do with the game itself edit it is now a gigabyte update i have xbox games that are smaller
1,i used to play it and i loved it ao i tried to get it again but its just become the literal worst game ever i have uninstalled so much even system stuff on my android and its still saying not enough and i have the a i hate this game now its the worst thing in existence if i had a pc i would have rated it better but why take out your rage on mobile players because its free like wth its so bad
1,i play this game from three year it is good but stroy is to slow please gives us a skip option for skip stroy line it is so boring and take long long time it is make your game so frustrating
1,the games characters are weak literally weak like the level difference means nothing you play wellyou are skilled but your character is weak af like a level can beat you easily even ifyou are level with a breeze just fix it
1,this game is pretty good but i was doing a ascesion test and when i was almost done the boss it suddenly completly revived after killing one of my characters and i did not have enought time to revive my characters i do not really recomend this game its very easy to rage quit
1,it is been years please please give android controller support i love the app but it is just that it is not that enjoyable knowing i have to use a gamepad while ios gets the legit app to implement it please just add that feature
1,this game suck ngl why i need to log in again and again after now playing for a while it is ok i did not really care about that what i care the most is everytime i try my password will be wrong and i will got frozen please fix it and i want my account back
1,updated again seven and after several more gigabyte of data later still no support for controllers on android why downgraded to one star
1,i saved forever will over wishes for wanderers main weapon and got nothingi am taking a break i feel abused after investing so much of my time in this game
1,to be honest i cannot really enjoy play the game why the downloading thingy is too much storage i cannot just delete everything in my phone for this i really want to try this game out
1,very good game to play but missing lots of qol improvements e giga remote support on android devices resin cap etc this causes a big disparity in game enjoyment across different devices and produces unfair advantages update still no controller support
1,repeated and boring daily quest run through the whole maps just to get ten primo too much unskipped story high ms and not even an free to play friendly game
1,the longest loading time i have been told that the game is cool so i wanted to play it but the loading took forever i was waiting for a half hour so please fix that problem if you can
1,i will be honest the game is really fun but i can never play it while i am completely comfortable the story of this game contains many things that contradict my belief and the belief of others and it also forces me to worship statues in this game indirectly and this is a great insult a game published to the public must be devoid of religious abuses and you can change these abuses only by changing the names of the characters from gods to kings or teachers for example
1,overall this game is good but after update last week why my account cannot login the game i already change my password and neither happens
1,it will not even allow me to play because it says i have insufficient storage space and i have gigabyte of internal storage space free and this is the third phone it is done this to me on
1,ar and this is my experience at the start it is very fun it is calm explor the world however late game it is just grinding you might as well spend hours on one character and you would still need to are it is weapon and get constellations it is very boring layer not alot of fun stuff and the end
1,good game i love it but uid in below at the right is show it not save for user paly in stream because everyone can se meby can make button desble or just remove that
1,did not let me border hop to japan with cooperative i have been wanting to visit japan for a while now so i decided to border hop seems like it did not work because it was raining me and my cooperative worked very hard to get to japan using ice but as said above it did not work
1,do not play this game it has one of the worst security ever my account got hacked and each time i contacted customer service and provided them with proofs of my transactions and they still will not help me get my account back
1,this program inserts a cookie that identifies you by processor serial number among other things they track and record all internet activities including exact pages and data on when and what you do on all pages note the risk of criminal use of this information
1,zero stars zero stars have to click at least one to post this the developers do not take their reviews seriously or even read them for that matter this game will not open cannot contact in game texhnical support if it does not open hmm it randomly kicks you off if you even make it past the loading screen which is a huge if started happening after their last update and now its a waste of time and major source for aggravation uninstalling this immediately
1,i have seen this game countless times and i thought it would be interesting but whenever i try to opwn the game it will always tell me that i do not have enough space in my phone i am angry that i cannot open this interesting game
1,i really love the game but after the update i log out my account on my phone so i can log in on pc and nowi am back from the start bec i cannot retrieve my account that is connected to my facebook and customer service sucks
1,this game relies on time gateing your progress so paying money to to progress faster also this game has alot time limted in game equitment that will never get reissued to the player base if you did not play the game during the month they gave it to the player the devloper is very much our way and complteliy disregard what the community quality of life feature they want in game if you okay these game type this give a ago if not skip the game
1,it does not work right it just charge data anf it is over the characters voice sounds choppy and it does not show a image
1,i have not even started playing and there is a problem i cannot even make an account because it always says verification code is incorrect or expired when i put it in correctly and it is new
1,the loading time is taking a lot of time i already have gigabyte it is still taking so much time to load i cannot play the game please fix this i hope there was a zero star in rating
1,this game is really good but not new player friendly so if you want to install it and never played it before then do not install it also have resources downloading problem
1,not great new phone no apps over gigabyte of space and some way some how i can not download the updates to even start the game due to no space error msg weak
1,could not create an account the way i wanted because their verification code included letters but i was only allowed access to numbers when i tried to change to keyboard it automatically moved to password space leaving the verification code line blank i tried repeatedly so i registered via my google acct and then it insisted i had no room for updating which was not the case this app stonewalled me the whole way
1,when ever i open this app i end up at my home screen and i have tried many ways to solve this problem but ntg worked and now i am not able to play this game at all it would be nice if the developer respond to this review and give any suggestions to fix this problem because i really want to play this game
1,ad for the game says explicitly you get free wishes when you join nothing at all has shown up anywhere to make me believe that is true false advertisement for click bait downloads
1,no skip button text transition too slow to proceed i personally do not care how much time spent to create the story cutscenes etc so please add a skip button or at least speed up the text transition do not force player to get into the story as some do not have much time to play a player like me would just skip everything and replay the story when i feel like it and i highly respect a game that gives much freedom to the players of how they enjoy their game
1,would love it there was an option to delete unnecessary data like past audio tcg card games and pretty much as many files as possible since the game is getting heavier each update and i would love to keep playing buti am not sure if my mobile device will run it smooth anymore in a few more updates
1,very time consuming i have been playing this game since and i kept up with it until middle at first the game was fun and entertaining especially the story but as more time passes by everythings getting more repetitive and the quests are so long even those world quests ones that is basically a filler in the game you cannot even skip the dialogues and it is so tiring having the spam spacebar wheni am on an alt account i guessi am just used to it from honkai
1,wish or five star character drop is way too low it took me attempts till i got a five star character which is mona on that attempts i only got two four star characters and some one three star items fix your game
1,great game but the problem is the developer itself because they think players who plays this game plays on their pc please be considerate your game is using up too much space on our phones
1,even on highest settings everything maxed out on fps it still looks like everything is set to lowest settings very trash experience on my galaxy ultra with snapdragon processor please fix the game asap
1,nweds a lot of space on your phone do not do it i deleted so many apps and this stupid game still will not fit i have a samsung note too this is nuts
1,i was just playing yesterday and now i cannot even open the app it is like when i try to open it it keeps backing up and just return to my home screen
1,could not move and fell through the map into the abyss not playable at all on my chromebook it kept warning me i was out of bounds in the middle of monstadt
1,absolutley no content even the abys is just anxety fuel because of the insane difficuly that you need at least one constellationfive star character for us free to play there is no way to pass it at stars even stars is such inanely hard with my maxed out constellationfive characters it took me an insane amount of tried to get stars absolutley discusting company giving nothing to play the game for uninstalling and never recommending it and whoever reads this keep your sanity and do not install this abomination money grabber
1,i do not want to give you a one star but when you make a long text and the story obviously long on the event and no skip button i just cannot help myself to say just how much time have i waste just to tap on every text the auto not even help
1,is there a possible way or permanent solution to install play this without deleting all apps on phone does it have to be buy a devices with large memory storage i want to continue playing the game
1,it definitely had potential i have been playing for two years but that is all there is to it no fun excitement or difficulty was involved with constant ignoring the fan base redundant and bland events and no real end game more importantly this game has certain cancerous mechanics like limited resin which are essential but you have to wait hours for more and daily commissions so you keep coming back but get nothing in return trust me i am not just another salty troll i had genuine love for it
1,this is a five star game but no controller support makes it damn near unplayable on mobile it is not the worst touch screen controls but they certainly are not good either and the fact that ios had controller support for over a year now proves that they absolutely can enable it but for some reason are just unwilling to edit updating my review march i would be giving this game negative stars by now if i could the lack of android controller support is full on negligence at this point
1,absolutely no problems in the beginning loved the game the art style was great i stopped playing for a while and updated it many times but it constantly tells me that there is not enough data to play the dang game i have deleted enough but it still tells me the same dang thingi am about to give up at this point this game is just taking up a lot of space on my phone
1,i initially liked the game but i have recently been let down and down again with genshins decisions and game design three five was a major one as they ruined one of my favorite characters by making her kit useless not only that but the weapon pity system is terrible and the lack of things to do in genshin makes the game feel more lackluster than ever
1,the game has good story and mechanics and a lot of the fun comes from trying out new characters so when my most looked forward to character not only comes out as complete trash but trash that will never have a rerun my fun for the game dwindles i was expecting her to be bad but i was planning to get her on her rerun with higher investment now she never will and all of my love for the game has gone not only will i never spend again i might never play again
1,it is a good game but i can not get over how uncomfortable the in game user interface feels the fixed positioning of the movement joystick into the bottom left corner is so awkward that i essentially can not move my character backwards at all the left joystick needs to be placed higher up on the screen or be allowed to follow the players movement i recommend the joystick settings on wildrift as a good example of customizable in game user interface
1,the game is amazing from story mechanics exploration etc they put so much energy into creating the combat system to be honest its one of the most fun rpg combat system i have played sadly they do not care about putting it to use and based on developer statement they have no interest in putting any content that actually makes use of characters abilities artifacts foods team building etc therefore as lovely and interesting all those characters are they are and will be sadly just eye candy
1,this game for me was a five star when i first started playing by the way i started since launch but after reaching endgame all of it goes to the bin lack of endgame no balance patches for outdated characters probably one of the worst anniversary rewards ever there so called anniversary rewards are just advertisements for there own game do not get me wrong the game is enjoyable and beautiful but only at a certain point this game is strictly casual
1,i really love the characters lore and the gameplay but this game deserves better the devs confirmed that there is no end game content if there was it is not about combat the story from events are locked which some of them have importance to other characters background and lore and no increase on resin which are very scarce and we need a ton to upgrade our characters that there are no use in the game because there is no way to test their full capabilitiesi am really disappointed hoyoverse
1,the devs are tone deaf two years later and that has not changed this game still does not have quest nesting it still does not have dialogue skip it still has not reworked the artifact system that is driving people away it still does not compensate players properly for their time it still does not have controller support for android it still does not factor any player feedback into the roadmap two years later this game still has all the flaws it had since launch way to preserve eternity
1,genshin started to randomly kick me out of the game it stops on the loading screen and has been kicking me out ever since this event this is app has crashed ten times i uninstalled and reinstalled to see if it would fix the issue but nope edit after three months they finally contacted me and asked if i was still experiencing the problem they messaged me saying they skipped over my email and asked if i was still experiencing an issue no compensation or anything just a half assed apology
1,it made my mobile restart two times now with two eight version it has been the worst gameplay if i go on playing monas domain the screen freezes every five second mostly in domains enemies appears like second after starting it in open world when the enemies appears and you kill them all you have to wait like more than a minute to get the energy particles and sometimes the energy particles never come also after watching the sumerus graphics i am quite worried about my further gameplay
1,would be a wonderful game if not for a few key problems endgame is terrible and leaves players with virtually nothing to do rng system is absolute hell and a huge obstacle to improving builds claims to take inspiration in the people and culture of the real world but fails to implement it in game without stereotypes and whitewashing the general lack of diversity in skin tones and body types is very disappointing not a single npc is non pale and playable characters are all thin do better
1,a lot of stuff getting worse by the update the latest archon story was rushed new characters are broken in a bad way spiral abyss is not hard but more of a dps check which increases each update there is still no update to the end game the only thing good are the events which are fun but they are not even permanent and new players cannot even experience them once they are gone
1,amazing graphics amazing story really good customer care but now the game is beginning to feel repetitive i have yet to farm a full set of best possible artifacts for any of my characters despite being at adventure rank it is like the game is bugged to give artifacts with bad stats so that people will keep playing i suggest you either remove this bad rng for artifacts or remove the resin system as it is becoming impossible to get the artifacts we want you do not strive to give the best experience
1,heard many amazing things about this game so when i got the chance to download i was really excited when i played it i was really disappointed it took extremely long to load and took up a bunch of space however that was not my biggest pet peeve about the game my biggest problem was that it would not allow me to complete my first quest every time i defeated two fire monsters it would keep on coming back by twos not allowing me to finish the quest i think it is a bug on only mobile
1,i do not understand why it does not support controllers and mouse keyboard when the desktop version does there is even an dropdown option for control types but you are locked to one option touchscreen whats the point of it being there if it does not hing the key mapping tab in the game is also empty in settings why if you are okay with touchscreen though the game is awesome
1,i love the gameplay but hate the leveling up system i feel like i should be rewarded more adventure rank points with every mission i prefer playing the story they have not side quests it just takes way too long to level up it also takes way to long to get enough primo for a banner i spent way too long just trying to grind in the past few weeks just to roll once if i was not so intrigued by the story i would quit they do not seem to care for free to play players i would not recommend
1,this is a game i jave enjoyed for over a year now but the newer versions give me a lot of headache if i open the app it gives me an in game notification that there is a newer version download it but as it sends me to the play store i have only two options either to play and repeat the cycle or uninstall it it is no fun to do that every update edit it does the same for two six update even after deleting an redownloading it making the game unaccessible and unplayable
1,great game no controller support and no mention of controller support yet ios has it i know it is probably more complicated than i think it is but it cannot be that complicatedi am a big spender when i play games and all of my money has gone elsewhere to other games this company has missed so many opportunities for revenue from me and others and all they had to do was add something simple to the game
1,reasoni am giving this one star is simply because the game will not work i want others to enjoy this game without any network error atrocities occurring but it seems no matter what i do the game will not let me in i just started playing and from the looks of it i cannot even start the game because of the stupid update errors i have tried everything to resolve this issue from youtube videos to even attempting to uninstall and clear the cache for the app but it appears nothing is working so
1,this game has gotten me through lockdown i like the graphics the story is decent enough for a gacha game bosses and farming are a bit tedious but still enjoyable the game is unplayable on my phone at this point it takes like three minutes on the lowest graphics settings for it to start lagging like crazy and overheating my device this issue was fixed as of version two four but once two five came out the issue came up again
1,at first it was very good now this game is horrible to play with phone voltage charge daily quest does not work also oh archon and gourmet suprimo does not continue even if i do it right i got the same quest again finally in the abyss it takes the enemies too much time to spawn feed back system shows an error and do not let me send any feed back
1,i genuinely do not like how the serenetea pot works you have to do a bunch of bugs and stuff before you are satisfied with the design or furniture i would like it to be easier to place furniture without having to do the bug or glitch merging items furniture freely it is just really difficult and i usually take half an hour to make one building because i have loads of bugs to do in order to make it pretty
1,the first thing that happened when i loaded up the game was a seven five megabyte download when i actually got into the game the cutscenes were way too much for my phone to handle it was searingly hot and the cutscenes were very glitchy after picking my character the game crashed and i was not able to open the app without it crashing again update i tried to download on my laptop which took two half hours then the game would not launch
1,i adore this game however the months and countless updates with ios having controller support and still absolutely no mention of it coming to android feels straight up disrespectful i cannot stand to play this anymore with touch controls i have put so many hours and dollars into building my team and it feels like half of the characters i cannot even use try aiming a bow user with touch controls until they bring controller support this game is no longer enjoyable for me
1,i used to enjoy this game but the bug is really affecting the gameplay for me and many others and mihoyo has not done anything to fix it when a character is too detailed it just shows as blocks this happened with enemies e giga stormterror signora but has recently happened with the new playable character yun jin i have changed the graphics quality many times but nothing helps please fix this
1,uh excuse me the new two four update completely obliterated my gaming experience first of all i cannot even see yunjin properly she is just a bunch of flashing colors enemy hp bar disappears when i use a five stars burst and the enemies are delayed the whole game became more laggy if it were not already bad when i could not see damage text the new version just made it more worse if you could solve this issue and do not ignore it like the problems mobile genshin had and still has back then
1,please fix the graphic glitch when fighting la signora and dvalin it is very hard to beat them when you cannot see due to the bug that the screen will be filled with something and able to see them if you do not know whati am talking about just go to youtube and type graphic glitch it is very hard to fix it and sometimes it cannot be fix because we do not know anymore ways howyou are the developers so please make this problem solved because it is ruining the game please fix this
1,the game gets too repetitive i wish there was more incentive to explore the open world instead of going to point a to point b using teleporters there needs to be more things to do rather than a few puzles and enemies randomly placed around the area the open world feels empty and just feels like it is just there with barely any purpose
1,good if you have a good phone with huge ram and compatible with it if not you may have stormterror bits covering your screen other sorta headaches as well like crashing in the middle of a boss fight and no dvalin not only that therere high level restricted limited time quests as well one of the reasons why i was not able to participate in them even when i started playing a long time ago took some time for me to know this and that it is confusing problematic greedy fomo and more bad
1,you have to really really want to play this game requires gigabyte of storage space gigabyte downloads when you launch the game for the first time the installation alone drained my battery from down to and took nearly two hours over stable internet connection after it finally installed and i charged my device i found that it is a wicked battery hog and the movement controls felt wonky at times overall the graphics are great and i liked the open world feel but ended up uninstalling
1,from what i can see this game is amazing its basicly the legend of zelda breath of the wild but made into a mobile game with elements and weapons that do not break yes it does take alot of processing power but do be fair my phone isint the best out therei am really enjoying this game and hope to see what else there is to explore you should give this game a try for sure edited looks like they do not care anymore also got boring real quick about a week events are the same and yea one five now
1,yall messed with the graphics in a previous update and made the game look and run absolutely awful the game takes up way too much space and now only the whales enjoy this because the games balance only favors those who spend a lot on it then there is that trash camera that constantly hides behind grass you have to upgrade every damn thing and unlessyou are spending alot you will be stuck what waste of potential this is a sad hill to die on had to uninstall
1,the storyline has so much potential but its executed so slowlyi am nearly adventure rank and from what i remember we only had around six quests in which there is useful information for finding our sibling i get that it is a new game with high graphics but updates take a month and a half and there is a lack of main story quests if people want to take things slow and enjoy the game and other quests they should have that option but a quest about our sibling should be released every two months at least
1,nice game nice graphic and story but the game is very easy and there are no hard contents in this game so there is no need for you to spend money in this game so if you are willing to spend money do not spend more than battle pass or walking moon it is not worth to spend money on it i gave it one star because early game it is so fun but late game when you reach level or above it will be so boring nothing to do other than doing commissions and spend resin then log out
1,i have seen ads about this and it seems pretty great but when i tried to download and open the app it just has a black screen i have been waiting for hours but it still does not load but when it did there was a pop up saying unable to load please try again or send feedback i tried to refresh the app but no when i uninstalled it and download it again it does not open the app anymore one star i really wanna play this so badly but somethings wrong with it please fix so i can give five star
1,have not played since the release of eula i had obtained all the units till then i gave mihoyo a long while to fix glaring issues with the game these include a lack of meaningful content and heavily paywalled characters yes you can use free ones just fine it does not mean being stingy with characters is ok gameplay is fine but bland we gave feedback on how to improve the game and they have rarely if ever materialized this game is something that i personally will steer clear of in the future
1,overall progress with updates have been dreadful initially the game did look rather promising with potential for a huge world and tons of exploration it was shaping up to be a great game with future updates i was very excited at the time however updates only occur once every two months and the updates are usually the addition of minigames that will take up about a few hours with no substantial content to them just a temporary distraction it has been almost a year until we actually got a substantial update with a whole new region which has been great buti am finding it very hard to believe it would take a whole year to create this when the real updates do come it is great but the pace of update releases have been awful even now with the most recent survey it does not seem like the company cares anymore previous surveys would gather more information if you did not like something an opportunity for constructive feedback in some way the most recent survey does not even bother do not like something okay cool and the survey moves on to the next question it started off as an exciting open world game with amazing potential but it has devolved over time endgame is doing your daily chores then logging off waiting for the next minigame drop clearly they have made their money and have lost the passion for the game
1,my experience with the game has been very decent due to lack of actually being able to save properly unlike other gacha games i have played it become really difficult getting any characters whatsoever that on top of the anniversary rewards which were godawful drops the game to one star gear system is fine really but resin system should not exist in an open world game
1,my review will not stay up when you start the game is really good the issue starts at higher adventure ranks there are less and less things to do and even doing your daily commissions seems like a chore it is a really grind y game very time demanding and it needs consistency since resin resets with time daily commissions are boring and repetitive especially whenyou are looking for a specific one overall bad game because of the bad late game experience
1,the design story and combat system are good but maybe the product manager or even the dev is the one who ruin it all breaking the equality of re run character maybe just for some new player instead of re run it equally for everyone in two two one there are the great unequal distribution between new female and male characters in two two one there are rushing new characters that cause the new unfinished characters but they still release them actually if they planed them to take turn with re run character they would have more time to finalize them we can say good bye to hydro character there are too few of them while there are too many pyro electro cryo character and hydro characters are quite underpowered which i mention above you can say there is no balance in this game in almost all aspect at all moreover something that need to be fixed but it can not be fixed due to a gacha rule so it is the end all we can do is accepting the fate
1,you may find it fun for the first few hours but after that its just a long boring grind with alot of filler events and time limit challenges the graphics and music are above average but the gameplay enemies exploration etc are mediocre at best do not waste your time on this game you will never feel rewarded for your time it also heats up your device very fast has significant loading times and does not make good use of being open world waited one year for a big disappointment
1,genshin is a good game until you reach late game after finishing quests and doing the abyss you literally just have dailies to do eg daily quests resin spending there is simply not enough late game content to enjoy this game longterm and unless you want to play once a day or take long breaks from the game four six months the rewards are usually also very lacking wishing becomes the only exciting thing
1,i like this game specialy the memes first the issue i am having right now was the cameras auto rotate when combat coz most of the time the camera auto rotate where the grass trees and etc blocks the view and i cannot see where the enemies at second was just a request i want a controller support on this mobile coz its really much better if i use a controller its really annoying when i have to open a controller mapper and a few hours later it will close or stop working it self
1,th attempt to get through to review blockade this game had so much promise at the beginning exploration and the sense of progression along with the characterization was great it all fell apart over time due to a lack of dialogue with the community characters have had parts of their kits non functional for almost a year a lack of meaningful innovation fishing and housing are nice but there has not been any permanent end game content added since launch its heartbreaking
1,not my type of game at all i thought the open world aspects and gameplay looked stunning but it is just a boring grindfest with very reptitive content after i played for release until around april of this year i realized how much of a waste of time it was and how little rewards the game gave for the amount of time and effort invested the rates of artifact drops resin replacement mora drops primo rewards and gacha pulls are horrendous it had potential but without new gameplay it died
1,very rough to play on mobile the archer characters have an insane disadvantage with touch controls and are virtually unusable most smart phones are not capable of running the game to its max graphical settings so it is an easy skip if you have a pc capable of running it
1,poor communication with the player base i have been playing everyday since release and the lack of action to fix game mechanic bugs all while being backed with continuous feedback from the players grinds my gears they are quick to fix fun game breaking mechanics but refuse to fix the slightest bugs that basically render characters annoying to play and or unusable to certain team compositions to top it all off the anniversary rewards were even more disappointing
1,predatory money sink the developers waste their literal billions of dollars on absolutely cringe worthy quests and one off events that have at most one hour of gameplay content in it they flatly refuse to release content that caters to the primary gameplay loops of combat or exploration in any meaningful amount the game is a grindfest toward a non existant end game which consists of a single minute abyss domain which can only be done once every two weeks
1,unfortunately the developers have truly dropped the ball over the last few months the quality of character gameplay design has been poor at best and the storys writing is declining to worrying levels additionally the lack of communication about the anniversary and future events is extremely disappointing i want to love this game but it is beginning to feel like there are too many flaws to overlook
1,while the game is good overall there really is not much to do in the endgame log in do dailies for max minutes log out as an endgame player the game is boring and repetitive and it feels like a job to play it at this point there is so little content and all new content is going downhill and getting worse repetitive boring overall fun in the beginning but repetitive and uninteresting in the endgame
1,after a year of playing this game i can safely say that it has many good aspects it is a beautiful world with some very fun characters unfortunately there is no end game lots of grinding for little reward resin based so you are limited on what you can do and new characters are jusy getting worse the direction of the game is unclear design is getting stale and mihoyo flat out does not appreciate it is player base was the years most beloved game now everyone is trying to shut it down
1,been playing for one year i would say the game was playable and fun until the recent updates it all just began to be so repetitive and boring the only thing that will probably keep you playing is the storyline which you can easily keep up with the manga it is fun for the first few hours then it all becomes too stagnant and feels more like a responsibility because of the gacha system
1,honestly i am disappointed played the game but was losing interest some characters are extremely lackluster but have good kits like xinyan split scaling second there is hardly any end fame content understandable its new but jeez you only spend minute the max in the game if you finish everything and only if you have resin three resin is so low for the amount of things it needs to provide for disappointed with this especially the rewards both anniversary and in game please fix these
1,not going to lie but the main story line is really what keeps me going in this game and maybe a little bit of stress relief and meta to become better at building things in the future even if the new quest was rushed it still managed to give me goosebumps which means in some way it was still good but unimpressive the game is slowly falling apart and the majority is quitting because of the games latest actions i do hope you respond to this issue as this one can affect the game so much
1,how is this game one year after it comes out one almost no end game content two a resin system that limits your progression so badly that you cannot get a decent level and equipment for the characters you have three when you are done exploring there is nothing to do four rng based five a first year anniversary event that is a slap in the face of many players and show how greedy mihoyo is almost no rewards were given the worst part is that players were asked to make advertising for the game lol
1,it was so much fun in the beginning but at endgame it is so grindy and you have basically nothing to do everything needs resin artifacts exp books talent books boss drops and the resins takes ages to refresh i stronger but in the end what for there is no endgame content i could use it for the serenitea pot was great too in the beginning but that was until i realized the load limit was too small for me to realize my ideal mansion in the end this is the final straw
1,i have always noticed the grinds you have to do in order to get the best gear each artifact weapon has gacha stats amount of pulls are kinda off putting things to do dwindle down and is just repeating although it is has a storyline overall if you are not willing to invest a lot of money i mean a lot you are gonna get a terrible experience look at the anniversary rewards trash given ten given back
1,game looks great and graphics are insane for a mobile game only problem is that when i get percent of download it tells me i do not have enough storage space i have plenty of space more than gigabyte needed but it still says i do not have enough space also heard that anniversary rewards are lazy and not worth it please fix this
1,the game is great initially especially if you love exploration however once you finished exploring as well as the quests you should quit because the endgame is a terrible grind locked behind rng and the biggest problem is the lack of communication with players selective hearing of feedback and censoring of feedback across social media regarding their really poor anniversary rewards just a roadmap or increased drop rates event would be good may not need free pulls
1,started off great albeit having lots of bugs especially on the first few patches fortunately most of them are already fixed but in game events are repetitive and boring some storylines are great but after you have finished it it is simply boring you just login for daily commission and to spend resin spiral abyss can be cleared in the span of day or less as a casual spender the only excitement i can feel in this game is the gacha but even the characters now are simply underwhelming or clanky
1,alright straight to the point story is awesome and the characters are very memorable the open world aspect is very fun to explore especially with friends but that is about it the resin system still sucks even a year in so at a certain point you just end up logging in to do your dailies and logging back out building your characters is entirely luck based and will get repetitive very quickly the lores great but at this point i would rather just watch cutscenes on youtube
1,after you finish the abyss there is noting to do no end game content lack of in game content by what i mean is too many web events takes you out of the game to claim rewards massive burnout playing this game like i have said there no end game goal for content to grind for no achievement to strive for as you play the game longer and longer you realize that alot of the content is recycled with few and far between gameplay changes even the rewards for events are lackluster
1,there are various issues with the game such as assets loading delays and game freezing during cooperative join also the update installation size is not optimized at all every time we have to install like the entire game and then it takes an hour to unpack it after doing this many times i realized it is quicker to just delete and do a fresh install but this should not be the right way to approach this problem also the game says it support background downloading the resources but the speed drops
1,the game has gone boring and feels like a chore every time that i log in do dailies and log out no new long content that keeps old and new players going some bugs are still not fixed e giga xinyans skill when hitting several enemies no changes to bad rolls bad artifact system bad resin system the game is a year old but the developers or corporate i do not know whos pulling the strings seem to not care about their playerbase at all this anniversary
1,developer does not listen to the community many bugs were still not fixed and instead they focused on getting new character out even then they still failed since the new character are broken as in weak clunky mechanic it showed absolutely no planning from mihoyo beside trying to make the character look good to appeal to those willing to pay for design only the final straw was the anniversary where the reward was absolute horrid a new low even for first anniversary
1,not worth it anymore it started being another chinesd gacha pros this game is so addictive at the beginning the visuals are great alot of thought was put into the map cons treats the community like trash becoming a cash grab at this point the stories are becoming rushed and a cringy dating sim instead of expanding on the characters and their motives
1,pretty enjoyable for casual gameplay just some adjusting to controls when it comes to targeting mobs it tends to get annoying to lose your intended direction to shoot your spells properly but overall it is not bad one year later glad i quit the game since january at adventure rank these rewards for hardwork and atrocious rng is horrendous lmao
1,some of us were already frustrated with the game by now am having second thoughts if i want to continue lack of endgame content no new abyss floors being added even or anything else not in the form of a temporary event refusing to buff characters at all that are objectively awful compared to their competition and complete lack of communication from the game devs has turned this game into something sad
1,i have been playing this game from the very beginning and i can say for sure it was extremely fun to start out but at this point the content has gone stale the rewards are extremely underwhelming andi am just burnt out at this point the resin cap system is the most frustrating thing of them all considering you have to decide carefully what you want to spend it on otherwise the moment you run out of it you really have nothing else to do
1,the fact that my previous review got removed for some reasons speaks how the state of the game is again all the things that you do in this game is rng based you farm exp books materials and artifacts you will get random number you try to upgrade your artifacts you will get random stats no need to sugar coat things it is a bad game design everyone should just avoid this game completely it is beautiful but not rewarding to play
1,i played this game religiously since release for about days according to their theater of your gameplay and me noting when i stopped when i finally got to the point where i just found no enjoyment from it my biggest issue was their inability to address endgame content or lack thereof artifact farming was it and it was atrocious it was so hit or miss that once i got even a semi viable set on a character i did not bother trying to upgrade it because it was always a sunk cost since their only end game was abyss and if you did not have the dream team and the right artifacts you would be lucky to three star the final floors this has been the case since the games release and never once was anything end game related added if they addressed their wonky drop rates for artifacts at the time of my playing it might not have been so bad but it persisted for so long that even after they added the ability to convert five stars it is too late for me to go back and enjoy the game it was a fun ride and i loved the characters but they did not put the work in to make it better
1,okk first of all there is the game itself it is really fun if you ignore the bugs and the visuals are beautiful but the rewards for their one year anniversary are absolute garbage like some events gave better rewards it is such a pity since i really enjoy the game but it is just not worth it when you feel like the company it is literally laughing in your face
1,it is used to be a good game with amazing gameplay design and ost but it is not worth to spend any more money on this the anniversary event is not remarkable not only reward but also events that should be designed for all players can participate they only care players who can draw and edit videos for free marketing purposes i have played this game for days and the anniversary event is very disappointing the quality of recent story quest is also disappointing
1,star it is not just about the anniversary rewards those are just one in a long searies of let downs like the kfc glider deleting negative replies and reviews ignoring a large portion of your player base and refusing to change or fix things that have been an issue sense day one it is a shame to see such a nice game that had so much potential go downhill so quickly but that is classic chineese for you silence anyone who disagrees with you been a nice year buti am out
1,i was one of the players who started playing since its official launch and honestly i fell in love with the game it has astounding graphics and awesome voice actors the background music and sfx was tantalizing there was too much to explore and it made it all the more addictive but as the game progressed there was less and less new contents some events were fun but some were just too cumbersome and not too rewarding events only gave primo enough for one two pulls then you get debate club
1,seems pretty fun so far even though there are way too many different things to memorize and collect also we need controller support one year later the game as expected became more and more predatory with its gacha system and the rewards are more stingier than ever even worse the new characters are released with poorly designed kits the anniversary rewards are laughable as well going free to play until things get better or until i get bored of the game and i would advise others to do the same
1,it is starts great but once you reach end game the lack of actual repeatable rewarding end game content mode other than time attack abyss the lackluster story writing of the latest update and for some reason the qol issues that this game has really makes it hard to support it further monetarily if this continues i would just switch to be a casual free to play player and support other games worth my money
1,really fun exploring and doing quests but after exploring everything and repeating the same quests over and over again it starts to get very boring and since upgrading characters fairly fast is locked behind a pay wall i am starting to play less and less and i had hope that this anniversary would be exciting and i could maybe start playing again but alas nothing happend i was really disappointed and i uninstalled it just now
1,everyday it just becomes harder and harder to continue playing the game very little to do in the end game terrible stamina system terrible reward system and nothing on the horizon to look forward to that could keep me grinding through this dry period to get to the next major update that is not planned to come for almost a year a year ago i thought this game was a five but now
1,once i rated five stars i liked the game and even spent money on it now i regret every single penny spent game rewards remains too little and the worst part is they are literally very stingy during the anniversary instead of giving mass rewards to players for once in a year event only selected players can obtain the rewards the game has become only worth to play by rich kids that never cared about rewards thanks for the memories mihoyo
1,whenever i start my game it just gets stuck on the bridge scene it is infinetely just building up and do not blame it on my device my device has six gigabyte ram and gigabyte space left and it is good enough to support fortnite it just stuck on the loading nothing else is there just the screen of bridge being build please fix my issue mi ho yo i know that you create good games but i am disappointed
1,this game is good though it needs to be updated more recently there is a bug in my phone where i get stuck at adventurer rank four it just stops the mission there so i cannot continue it please fix this i got good internet and i did not run background apps yet it still bugs i will make it five after you fix the bug because overall its a good game you just need to fix this please
1,this game will only be fun for two months at most after two months just delete the game it is just a grindy garbage the game restricts progress with resin system and horrible rng permanent content is non existent the open world is basically dead after the first one two months of exploration the story is amazing but archon quests only comes out once every few months so it loses momentum unless you want to waste your time on hours of unmeaningful content do not bother playing this gacha trash
1,i was primed to really dive into this game but i fired it up on my razer phone two with razer kishi controller got through the tutorial to access settings and discovered controllers on android are not supported really disappointed especially since controller support on ios has been available for a little while now i will be back when support is added but cannot enjoy it on touch interface until then
1,to be fair it is a great game great graphics and controls i wish you would add a feature to remove old files or videos that are not needed for save files that are far in the story so there is no need to keep that huge a file for phones with small storage space i used to be able to casually play this on my phone until the zhongli update now i cannot i have had it uninstalled and although i have it on pc it would be great to still have it on my phone so i can play it anytime and anywhere i want
1,the game does not work i have three five ram and i did not even make it to the playthrough my phone literally crashes if i ever play it my phone was build for gaming i played pubg mobile cod mobile mobile legends sucks and many more games but this is the first game to have ever needed so much ram in the entire history of phones please fix it like make the settings super low so i can probably play and adjust it if i have a better phone
1,i have been playing since klee banner and i must say every update the lags and crashing of game keeps getting worse than the previous one unplayable and customer service response is close to null it is been months and i cannot see an improvement on game playability you will be frustrated by the game crashing and not being able to play normally
1,from five stars to one why well if the game can change a lot of them problems that most of us are dealing with bugs and everything are common issues but the content of the game is getting boring as the time goes by the hype train for a week is fine but afterwards it goes rolling down the hill i used to love this game so i hope mihoyo will make some changes or at least try to make some
1,preface this only applies to the mobile version of the game pc version is a four five star the phone variant feels terrible to play even on my slightly higher end phone note ten big screen loads reletively fast laggy controls feel clunky and the cherry ontop is that the game fails to load with the most recent update crashes or freezes up immediately upon loading in to mondstadt
1,used to be my favourite game but since update cannot play it on my phone because its so slow when it comes to fighting even though my options say it is running smooth it is a shame because i loved this game and have had to delete it cannot really afford to go out and buy a computer for one game really is a shame that updates make a game better but can wreck it at the same time
1,bruh loading screen graphics are the only thing that i can look at it takes too much storage and slows the entire frickin phone down i cannot even play the game without my phone having a warning about it taking too much storage and is about to delete other data it also takes a lot of data and battery so yeah its not that your game is bad i just do not want my phone to explode
1,i absolutely loved this game i would play it for hours on end when it first came out however i stop playing due to a new job and less time when i went to play it again recently an update was request but after the update the game requested my log but bounced back account error and when i input my email it tried to back me start from the beginning of the game i would love to give it five stars but i need to be able to access the game with my progress back
1,so the game is fun interactive and well made put the app itself is pretty trash i play on pc and can fight bosses with ease but when i play on the app the buggy laggy second bad controls make it very hard to do anything short of daily commissions and small task the game is great but the app needs a massive amount of work
1,now that i have your attention allow me to tell you that genshin impact is one of the greatest rpgs i have ever played however the mobile experience is just a nightmare it crashes doing the most mundane things such as fighting random enemies and jumping too much but the worst offence is that whenever you want to rematch childe for mats sometimes the game screen will dim and you cannot do anything in game this also happens after the transition between the second second third phase of the fight
1,what a beautiful almost unplayable game the camera swings wildly around during combat and trying to scroll up and down takes forever the onscreen buttons do not respond properly for combat and getting weapon upgrades is too difficult the challenges are not explained well often with a timer but no directions on whatyou are supposed to doi am done wasting my time with this game
1,game keeps freezing up and crashing my pixel a no gamepad support tired of game developers not including support for gamepad controls that would make games like this one much more enjoyable to play on a small screen the game is beautiful and has great voice acting but instead of making it percent complete they decide to skip on something very useful and wanted by many who knows if they will add gamepad support later but it is something that should be there from day one
1,having issue using bt earphones the sound is very distorted and has a lot of static and i do not want to play on speaker it is kind of a deal breaker for me if i find a fix or it gets fixed i will update i have a few friends playing the game on pc i will probly download it there but i would also like mobile to work
1,i love the game so far the graphics are awesome and the gacha system was not as bad as i thought it might have been however i do have problems when it comes to cool cut scenes they keep freezing up and i can only hear the audio there is also a terrible glitch that freezes my whole phone the game would lag so bad then it would freeze my phone and i would not be able to turn it off for hours please fix this
1,in it is current state the game is not particularly good i love the story world and characters but i cannot play the only thing i have left to do is to upgrade characters which i cannot do because every gold exp weapons gear character level up meaningful resource is tied to the energy resin system i will not try to get more characters anymore because of this there is also very little to do in the world after you have done the main big quests and because of that it is very boring
1,you did not hing with the feedback given to you in regards to the resin system you increased the cap from to but left the recharge rate untouched we are still hard capped at resin every hours one resin per eight minutes eight minutes hours good job at having us fill our surveys to give feedback and then you just put in a psuedo fix that will appease those unaware of how the system works fix this trash system decrease the time between resin recharge
1,i love the storyline and graphics on the game its amazing the only thing that ruins the game is the bugs i cannot see far the graphics would not load i cannot enjoy the full experience such a waste i waited about two hours for it to finish downloading is there any way this issue can be solved
2,ever since the fontaine update i have lost like six account if i go into fontaine on a new account and the game crashes or i leave the game i can never log back into it during the elemental loading screen when it gets to geo and fully black my screen just freezes and i get things like system user interface is not loading and stuff like that or i get nothing and i am just stuck there till i somehow manage to close the app
2,ever since dropped i started to lag very badly at fontaine the lag i am talking about is so severely bad that when i start to lag on the spot it will freeze and it either crashes or i have to restart my phone just to get out and when i try to go back to play it will not let me in anymore it will just repeat the geo logo over and over again this usually happens when i go deep in fontaine in underground areas of it i hope this get fixed in time for bcs i do not want to miss furina
2,nearly every time i try to play it asks me to redownload everything from scratch this happens at least once a day and my game is always crashing other than those issues it is a really fun game that i enjoy playing with good graphics character design and story the crash may just be my phone also
2,i really love this game it is very amazing the storyline is great but i do have problems while playing this recently i went to a place in fontaine but when i went there my phone suddenly lagged and went black when i tried to open the game again the loading screen would not load the geo symbol would be half and then full and then it would turn half again and then it would all turn black and restart to the first loading screen please help me fix this
2,if your looking for a casual game to play on the go that is open world by all means play the game but once you reach end game it just feels like a chore and with all due respect i have seen games that celebrate the years of its being released and this game has by far the worst rewards in doing so i have played many games similar to its genre and i standby when saying it is reward for celebration was by far the worst of all time also the game does not like rebalancing old characters so rip
2,the good beatiful graphics fun collection of characters interesting mini game dynamic able to cooperative hard bossess and satisfying world exploration the bad extremely repetitive quest progression cannot skip cut scenes over abundance of unnecessary dialogue that does not add to the expierence due to terrible pacing gacha aspect is quite mind numbing since the low tier rewards are throw aways no mobile controller support
2,it is a beautiful game i will admit that but i cannot get pass the reminiscent drift in sumeru it keeps freezing on the same scene it is when paimon says that it look like inuzuma i have done everything i could to make it work i have deleted it and re installed it restart my phone delete it for a couple of weeks before downloading it again but it still will not work i do ask for assistance for this problem as it had been a long time and i want to finish the quest and see fontaine
2,being a day one player i have seen quite a lot with is game i do enjoy it to an extent the main story is interesting but the world quest have way to much dialogue that at some points it gets very tedious and boring game play is very fun at least in my opinion the characters are pretty unique but my biggest problem right now is the weapon banner for this game some how i always get off banner weapons which have a lower rate than the ones advertised it really makes me not want to keep playing
2,everything is great on the game both graphics animation characters and story line but i am sure a lot of mobile players are having this kind of problem camera height camera height are too low and the camera height randomly gets even lower when you are in battle making it more worse and probably lastly you cannot customize your buttons mistouch is pretty common in mobile games and it is annoying like this game has been out for like three years but still no improvements on the controls
2,overall an awesome game but unfortunately a complete waste of time because aside from the game itself taking up a lot of space on my gigabyte phone the updates are even worse i cannot play anymore because i cannot make any more room on my phone for the next update i have deleted personal pictures and videos to make this game fit and it still does not this is a completely avoidable problem there are plenty of other games like this only not as fun to play that do not take up my entire phone
2,this app is very nice but the problem is that it takes alot of storage and that is not good i honestly tried it on my ipad but i had to delete all my other apps to play and that is sad and not fair plus according to your prices this game is kinda just waste of storage and it almost broke my ipad i recommend playing this game but you need to at least have a very great storage to hold everything
2,i stumbled upon new character which got my interest back to play once i start grinding day and night plus buying the gamepass which is known as the blessing of the moon still it did not do well but end up being a scumbag gambling game the game is fun if you are like to explore and have a challenging adventures but if you are mostly interested to in game character you are most likely will not get your favorite character at guarantee because the game system rules for pulling have gone strict
2,one would think with all the updates someone would actually know how to fix the continuously glitching why is genshin the only game by the same developers that made the other two or three games that do not glitch would make sure there first one does not have any glitches two stars because of the story graphics and sound
2,i have stopped playing because i just cannot tolerate the onscreen controls the game has been out long enough and has had so many updates that it should have controller support by now graphics are great gameplay and character design is super fun and i enjoy the synergy but what it is lacking on android is the fact that it does not have controller support so if it ever gets it i will be back but for now peace out
2,the game overall is really good but i constantly have problems regarding space and downloads i downloaded the pre install yesterday and believed all was smooth sailing but after updating on google play this morning it asks me to download a file the same size as the game gigabyte it does not seem like a glitch and reseting the game does not fix the problem
2,honestly almost every part of the game is great but when it comes to certain quests with long diolag it becomes worse than some of the other games because i checked everything in my phone and it says it has great signal but it keeps disconnecting and because of the overwhelming long diolag it keeps restarting at the start of the dialogue meaning for some quests i can never complete on a phone that is bound to go places with bad reception
2,honestly this game is great mostly as a bigginner but as you move forward and reach endgame content in which it does not exist at all you realize how big its own flaws are i enjoy this games combat it is reactions it is artifacts system but why make me grind for something that i will not even use most of the time it stops being fun the moment you can kill your enemies with a slight sneeze but the over world and exploration stuff is wonderfully done do not expect much of combat endgame though
2,clunky controls severely lacking on qol bad story telling unnecessarily long irrelevant unskippable dialogues no content at all for long term players jam packed with fomo characters weapons story and events what little content there is is either mind numbingly easy or frustratingly near impossible no in between devs been ignoring feedback for three years great for a free mobile game though especially if you like tcgs
2,while the gameplay and exploration are fun and the story and characters are engaging issues like racism sexism sexualisation of minors and the very predatory monetization systems make me want to find a similar game without those problems even if it is not as fun but i have not found another one yet
2,needs improvement i have been playing this for quite enough time to tell you that it is a gamble if you do not want to get yourself into pain and betrayal then stay away this game has something called wish which is like you earn in game and spend on that to get your favourite items but the garbage thing is that they do not let you have free primo as complimentary genshin really needs some heavy update that will solve the issues of very high ping in asian servers fix it asap
2,it is amazing the game play the story the graphics but everything becomes useless because of horrible ping of even though my network is good because of that switching character becomes stupid constantly disconnects and reconnects making the gameplay horrible and lore irritating please focus on fixing the ping using vpn is irritating game is actually a five start plus just ping
2,the creator is kinda greedy so many dl and we still aint getting anything bearly enough energy to just hop on and hop off cannot even farm artifact effectively without spending after repeating commission and spending energy after months and days this game gets still you lose interest and move on also some of the dialogue is tedious long i will fall asleep halfway fontana has one of the worst talk no justu story ever
2,grapic is amazing but farming material is a pain should just give me a way to buy it with cash story has way too much talking even though it has an auto but i have to still make choices that do not not matter it very much needs a skip button it takes hours just to do a story even though it barely has any game play in it
2,no matter how i think about it the battle content in here is still lacking for a game where there are many characters those character does not mean much outside of the team that you use daily and after building a couple of strong unit there is not much meaning on building the rest please add more end game content other than abyss you have focused too much on world buidling i know it is an open world but the core game is also the battle right so why are there so little battle content
2,i have finished downloading almost gigabyte of games but when i want to play i often get stuck on initial loading in the check for update when i use a cellular network the solution is that i usually have to close the application and change to a internet connection connection and enter the game again and do not get stuck on that part i have been playing for a long time in and it seems like this is the first time i have experienced it even though my connection is very good ms stable in game device mi t
2,i enjoy playing genshin but aying it on mobile device is not the best experience for me everything is slow when i run this game i just wish j had a better experience when playing it on monile the thing is it is not compatible for all devices sadly
2,i think that obtaining nearly every kind of upgrade through luck instead of earning it is a really bad design but anyway we are talking about a gacha game other than that the combat is like spam every attack button when they are ready and switch to the others characters to repeat the cycle anyway the main story is not bad and it is the only thing that makes me play the game
2,the game is good but it takes so much storage the story progresses really slow it is hard to grind and there is too much dialogue to play but the sounds are kinda good the thing i do not like the most is that it is really long to play and grinding is too slow
2,hello hoyoverse i need help i am downloading the in game data right now and the speed is buffering i have a good internet connection i know it and i think the problem is the game can you fix it the download speed is like jumping it keeps pausing to kb and then download again and repeat please help i want to play this game
2,it is fun however you have to save up to get more characters and that can take time also the chance to get a really good character are low also it is gigabyte so unless you got that much storage do not get
2,i want two things first person view gameplay with traveler only i want to lay down on the grass we can sit so please add option to lie down anywhere i want to relax and enjoy the view and the moving clouds bonus i want a pet the cat button actually this game deserves five stars i just wanna get your devs attention i will change it back
2,is a great game if you do not have the inexplicable disconnect issue despite having a solid connection been experiencing disconnects that occur every minute to few minutes making some challenges and events impossible to complete
2,game will not work on chromebook bruh how am i suppose to play at school now my phone running out of storage so disapointing i waited until it avaible but not even playable game either freezes on home screen or crashes when piling the shaders and i have way more then enough storage to fully download just that the game got issues and is a complete waste of time if your gonna download and play on chromebook highly advise you not to waste your time
2,i enjoy this game but since yesterday i cannot play it anymore the game is stuck on the loading screen part where all of the elements are presented and when it reaches the geo element after it fully loads the geo element it goes back to being half of the geo element and freezes and crashes i have tried uninstalling the game and reinstalling it but it did not work this game is compatible with my device so i hope i can have some guidance from the developers on how to fix this
2,i was an fantastic game the reason i gave two stars for this game is the missions that are in this are very tough as it was all equal to pc users we cannot switch as fastly in mobile like pc so for mobile version you ease missions and even crystals are also very tough to reach as it is an pc game you adjust it for even mobile users also
2,loved this game but now i cannot even play it on my nokia x everytime i load up the game to play the door opens up and a white screen stays on until it boots me back to the intro screen what makes it worse is that the issue started a few days after i purchased the daily gem package so i was not able to redeem the daily gems from that purchase
2,optimize your game i hate to rate this so low because it is truly a great game but there is so much this game needs work on in optimization especially running very slow at times on more than capable hardware i can forgive the lackluster graphics compared to ios because i understand its not easy optimizing for diverse chipsets but there is no excuse for missing controller support you are a multimillionaire company there is no reason why three years later we still are forced to use touch controls
2,i will return to give you a higher rate after i play it if all this space you are taking up is worth it right now you are just taking my space and killing my battery yes i am going to keep this rate i am not fond of it it is way too big to keep and i do not like the controls jumped up a mountain twice and kept falling it killed me before i ever did anything i mean why does the little joystick change direction when i do not take my finger off the screen
2,this game is very fun if you manage to download it the fontaine update has essentially prevented of mobile players from accessing it because the update requires so much space and my friends have said the update download took them up to two hours i and people i know who play this game personally can not access it on mobile anymore
2,i really love this game but i why cannot i open my account on the second phrase of loading it always stop right on geo and also my phone began to crash too this also the second time being crash on the game i had still a lot a space of my phone but why cannot i start the game
2,game is good but somehow gets hmv high ping of the order of ms from jio network even when giga g is running smoothly without any difficulty can play p p video on youtube without buffering but here ms ping and many times gets ms ping only fed up with this and thinking of deleting the game on internet connection too it gives ms ping
2,i am trying to retrieve my account but it is so hard to do so so much hassle they ask for specific dates first log in and last online date which my human brain cannot remember purchase dates and amount playstore somehow only show till october and if you have multiple account this will not help whatsoever hoyolab account do not have that feature where any players can see everything i hope they add this feature to hoyolabs even if not in hoyolabs this is just way too exhausting to do
2,had to load many times before the game worked after going to a shrine a faster way i had to go back and re do it because i did not follow the fairy girl it is telling me i can swim even though i was just there i wish the game would let me discover how to play and not force me to hold it is hand edit i got addicted to this game on pc and now like the mobile game too
2,got ultra boring exploration was fun in the beginning now it feels like a chore and there is nothing to do in the game after a while and the storage just keeps increasing every few months stupid gatcha no anniversary rewards and they are stingy af to give anything for free please do not download this game
2,when ever there is a new banner like to it needs a lot of storage space and until it is a lot of rerun there will be no space to download because of storage space like for example me although i like this game but it is about storage issue that this game takes up
2,i love the game but recently there seems to be a lot of glitches like alot i cannot switch characters during combat and the game automatically restarts during events
2,it would have been a really good game but the company kinda abandoned the game and does not listen to players at all also the character design both looks and kit is dropping drastically
2,it is and still no skip button most of the quest are just asking you to travel to a specific location to just witness a long and boring conversation between the characters geez i swear i have been just talking to characters for like hour freaking archon quest add skip buttons also your weapon banner in this version is terrible
2,pls decrease the amount of storage it takes up and the level of graphics it is just too much my phone gets so hot while i play my fingers get burn marks because of the high storage and graphic hope it gets fixed genshin used to be the only game i used to play but i quit after playing for one year
2,this was a really good game until i cannot log back into my account it would automatically log me out and i would have to log back on for a while that worked but now it will not allow me to log back in i really wish they would fix it because i like this game
2,it is a good game with phenomenal gameplay and immersive storytelling the only problem i have are the rates for the artifacts and their substats it can really ruin the experience and break the desire to pull for new characters when everything you receive are either mediocre or have a very high chance of being one after you level them up please consider readjusting the rates def and hp are not often as essential as you may think
2,hi i gave a legitimate review no bullshit at all and they have deleted it three times game good gacha bad thank you this super needs controller support it is so difficult to play with touch screen controls
2,hi small whale here i have played this game for over two years now story is better than you would expect exploration is cool combat is fun but i am fully ready to quit the artifacts farming experience is an insult to your time as a player why pull these awesome characters when you cannot build them imagine logging in every day for two months to farm a new domain to end up with nothing worth using honkai star rail gets custom artifact items and increased resin we just get frustration
2,no controller support is this a joke this game is the perfect kind of game to play with a controller but the devs refuse to even broach the subject game otherwise is very fun to play even if you do not spend any money a real shame you have to use clunky touch controls
2,i gave this so low because it lags so bad and nothing else is open on my phone my download speed is mbps and mbps upload speed i have gs left of space on my phone but i cannot enjoy this game at all for the lag the loading screens are obnoxious as they play for a second then the noise stops then starts i cannot see the video my character runs in a direction i do not want her to because of the lag i have all the settings turned down i have force closed and cleared cache and rebooted
2,listen i have been playing genshin since the game was peak the characters were great content was fun and it was overall a fun experience but however many times i come back from burnout i still have the same problem the hook that genshin used to have is not there anymore with the release of sumeru it just became dull content became repetitive and genshin just seemed like a chore the storage just is not worth the experience it brings anymore
2,its beautiful great lore character designs world structure fun mechanics on the other hand characters still have synergy issues characters that need a buff are ignored the endgame is nonexistent constellations damage some characters with no way to reverse it resin still needs to be improved load outs for artifacts would be nice the devs have ignored issues i think its worth playing but not spending money also they spit on their players every anniversary
2,it is very glitchy and i cannot play it for longer then ten minutes or else it will just automatically kick me off the game because of how laggy it is it is a good game trust me but this might just be a me problem it is very annoying when i actually want to play the game
2,the chats are having an issue where anything i write random words like because sometimes game get censored for some reason it has become a real hassle recently it is so difficult to talk to people on coop one day i open the game and the chat filtering system is messed up for every english speaking players please fix this issue
2,although this game felt truly magical upon playing it at first there are way too many downsides for it to actually be good the endgame content is nothing but spiral abyss farming and doing any leftover quests quests are often boring and long and there is no skip button for the cutscenes character upgrading is much too costly and takes too long artifacts are a total joke the gacha is predatory as hell and with how little gacha currency you receive not worth it
2,everything you heard is true great graphics animation and music with deep combat and exploration especially for a mobile game it can be fun and engaging but the games does alot to hamper that excessive traveling mindless encounters and quest design excessive dialogue excessive grind in two years the game has improved on much of its flaws the update events offer good opportunities to revisit the game can become boring and repetitive but you can still have fun and enjoy your time
2,only visual and gameplay is good rest of them are trash long story conversation wasting time especially paimon please make her quite paimon its the worst thing that i found in this game i hope future you make a simple conversation in any story note i am here just want to play a game not watching anime or drama
2,now do not tell me about rules and such i lost five times in a row i have not won a single and they come home always in pity even my guaranteed characters always come home on pity i saved up many fates to get the characters i want but i always lose i have not even got a limited five star that came home early pity they always come home on hard pity i started with many fates but always get disappointed i am adventure rank and a low spender so i try not to spend much in this game
2,been playing for the last three year and i keep inserting artifact loadouts end game content and the resin increase for the longest and i think this need improvement especially the loadout its frustrating having to search the artist well let us see if my review will have better result than keep inserting feedback in game
2,i download this game in all of my devices but it just keep saying that insufficient data even though i have enough data and whenever i click confirm it just restart over and over please fix this i really want to play this game but it seems as if it do not want me to
2,game becomes boring very fast the new events they put out are all temporary content and they are made in such way that anyone without some major disability could them nothing ever really challenges you the game just uses cheap tricks to get you to log in each day stay away if possible
2,the game is alright but the main story drags on for so long that i am no longer interested in seeing it and many of the side quests are pretty bland cooperative mode multiplayer is barely worth it it is extremely limiting and the only things that is worth doing multiplayer for can only be done on single player there is literally no reason whatsoever for this to be an online only game why is there even an option to change the controller settings if it does not use anything else but the touchscreen
2,the game is cool and all based what i see on the internet but i have encountered a problem on the app using a phone that i cannot move it to my sd card because if i try to download the resources it just in the internal storage but not going to my sd card where i want the resources to be downloaded
2,as long as i try to play the game genshin impact the game does not load or it tells me that the space is full knowing that the space is free and sufficient or when i try to log in it tells me that the password is wrong please solve it quickly because i am really excited to try a game with this high quality
2,yeah i see genshin impact is a good game but the problem for mobile players is that the storage is way too much and we beg you to reduce it other mobile players has quitted playing this game because of the large amount of storage needed dear hoyoverse i hope you see this review of your game and do something to gain mobile popularity back
2,nah man the first time i downloaded this game it needed about gigabyte storage i was able to have fun with it even though it was leggy then i was forced to delete it because it was legging my phone and now this year it took about gigabyte storage to play on mobile so i suggest the if you have a normal phone do not download it
2,good game but the problem is that the graphics on mobile is bad as hell almost impossible to play without getting multiple lags
2,after the download and the tutorial the game keeps crashing and exit on it is own because of this problem i uninstall it so if you can fix this problem maybe i would be back and play this game
2,the new update is crashing my device it keeps turning off my phone as well restarting the app and phone nor forcing the app to stop on settings does not work please fix this
2,long time player returned after more than a year to try the new regions while the game is truly delightful the rewards from hoyo for third anniversary celebration is really awful and pathetic it completely baffles me how such a billions dollar earning company can be so stingy towards regular long term players even on the occasion of game anniversary
2,i love this game but just after the new region fontaine my phone keeps lagging and crashing now i cannot even log in to my europe account so i made a new one asia to start all over again i wish this issue is fixed in the upcoming update
2,boy do i have some words to say so basically i quit the game around baizhus banner i did get back on for ventis birthday letter but that was it i decided to play again today for some dang reason there are now giant black squares and missing textures they are see through all over on grass patches tree leaves and whatever happens to be far away i have never had this problem ever and it happens even on the highest quality i do not know what the heckin problem is but it is annoying
2,i could not play it because i had deleted loads of stuff and i have no more photos and bearly any apps but it still wanted me to get rid of more i think thay needed to be changed because i hade to dete pictures of my dead dog bit i used to be able to play it and i have deleted what i did last time and it will not work
2,the game starts nice but as soon as you have exhausted the limited content you grind through a boring and frustrating loop that gives inconsistent and unsatisfying rewards locked behind many layers of randomness instead of making new permanent content for the game most development time is spent on creating short lived uninteresting and repetitive events do not get attached to the game it will not thank you for the time you put into it
2,its a great app at first but if you play on mobile it sometimes starts glitching and starts moving the screen left and right when you do not want to the updates also take too much storage and i have not been able to play the actual game because i could not update it since the release of fontaine if you can fix this issue then it would be greatly appreciated
2,graphics and character designs are nice and storyline is interesting but i just cannot accept the fact that this game takes up too much storage i have enough storage for this game but the download takes so long there is this new thing called shaders thing and i know it is supposed to make the experience better but it literally took me minute how do you expect people to be so patient about this when you have to wait so long just to play a game
2,this gane is fun but there is alot of bugs too i do not know if my phone is the cause but lags its obviously lags gyroscope is not working i do not know if my phone just does not supports it but the camera will not move even i move it everywhere that is all i got
2,i want to play the game and explore the map but as an adult i do not have time to go through bullshit dialogues same comissions waste resin daily which i cannot convert to fragile skip function for the repetitive aspects of the gameplay would have been nice quitting as of now because it is too time consuming earlier days were way more fun as updates pushed out game became more and more boring and chore if you are in your teens you will enjoy the game if you have responsibilities less likely
2,no fix on eulas animations even for her rerun no fix on raiden and beidous burst not interacting no fix for dehyas myriad of issues the game is crazy good but it is super slow with quality of life changes star rail literally fixed all of genshins issues and genshin still has not caught up
2,genshin impact is an overall great game but it is not something you could continuesly play stories after you finish a story quest you would have to grind exp just to be able to do another quest and grinding exp is really time consuming and boring as it does not give lots of options to how you can get exp and usually gives a small amount it makes it feel like there is a gap with each story quest and gets confusing overtime i really want to play the story but i just do not think it is worth the time
2,been playing the game for years now and to be honest the game gets boring once you already done with everything story hangout world quest and exploration the game does not have much ending content except for the abyss alone that resets every two weeks wish they added more end content
2,dear mihoyo been playing smoothly since two years account made with facebook and now suddenly it is say something went wrong and we will fit it asap but has not done yet my so much progress is on so fix facebook issue two star
2,i can no longer play genshin impact because of the large amount of storage it takes up literally a good of my phone my genshin and now i just cannot it was fun while it lasted please try to do something about the storage please
2,i cannot even play the game it says that i have insufficient storage and i deleted almost all of my apps and it still says the same thing thx for your help but i checked how much storage it needs and deleted the apps i needed but it still say insufficient storage
2,because of the story but not higher because there is no controller support for android do not get me wrong love the story and the game itself but the fact that controller still is not supported for android is frustrating and annoying sometimes this is all i can play on and if there is no controller support for my phone then fml would be a much more avid player if controllers could be added onto andriod devices
2,the automatic closing out of this game is very irritating i can only play a short time before it closes then i have to reopen the game just to keep playing i am becoming increasingly irritated with the constant crashes fix this about the game and it will be perfect i already know my phone has the requirements so you can stop with the misleading excuses
2,do not bother installing this game on your phone except if you have highly performance phone because the large amount of data to download and the game keep updating until your storage is not enough i highly recommend to play this game on pc thank you i am not into this game cause i feel like throwing up and feeling sick i think it is called motion sickness so do not play if you have the same sickness as me
2,worst customer service i have ever seen also extremely stingy developers some mechanics with resin energy and couple of other small stuff can be changed fixed graphics are good enough story landscape world and character design are amazing
2,love the open world and game mechanics its just annoying there is no dialogue skip button developers think its gonna make us spend more money if we are forced to pay attention to every conversation but honestly its just killing any passion i have for this game having to skip minute of dialogue with your finger every individual chat box at a time is annoying also having to do the same boss without having a complete fast button so you do not have to actually do the fight over and over again
2,i have been playing for a few years now but there is absolutely no way this is a mobile game the amount of storage it takes up is insane you would think the devs would compress the files to make it functional for mobile players in the same way it is for console pc players new fontaine update has outdone my gigabyte of storage space the game itself is gigabyte i have gigabyte of storage free after deleting everything i had but the amount is still insufficient for the new update please fix this soon
2,i like the graphics and the story but game gets very frustrating new characters are made to look stronger in abyss every month while making it impossible for free to playplayers to do anything characters fall off the meta very quickly and no matter how much time and effort you put into a character once they fall off the meta they are useless it is tedius and very frustrating
2,please let us completely skip dialogue and cutscenes it is the reason i quit since most events and main stories is super time consuming and filled with me frantically clicking my mouse to go next in the dialogue some world bosses which are needed to ascend some characters are blocked behind finishing main stories i do not care for the cringy family friendly storyline but i like the world exploring and battle skills the grinding for artifacts sucks but i did not mind it after a while
2,i love this game sm i play this game to be honest in my old phone but when i installed it in this phone it says my storage is full even though i still have more storage hoyo please fix this i really want to play this game with my friends and i miss farming for characters too
2,its a great open wide game where you can unlock all sorts of charecters but when you first load the game and there is updates it takes for ever to load i understand that there is a lot happing but several hours unnassasry at first it was just on my phone but i downloaded it on my pc with different account but now it will not even open it long enough to do anything might be just mine but frustrating
2,i like the combat i just hate gotcha systems i would rather spend money and know what i am getting you hit a wall pretty fast if you play for free
2,amazing map and music however traveller does not say anything and it feels off needs constant bug fixing for mobile and ps graphics should be improved for high performing mobile phones not just iphones i insist on the graphics quality it is not ethical that apple has exclusivity for better graphics they should advertise their products without limiting an independent game for others got a rog six capable to handle the game but the graphics are roblox level ruining the whole experience
2,i am giving two stars because after updating the latest version it says it failed to update so i was like okay but then i checked my storage and it did download i am stuck at the element screen it will lit up until the hydro icon then after a minute it will reset and turn to all white i was so confused i even uninstalled the game then install it again wait for almost an entire day just to experience the very same thing i am so disappointed this never happened before
2,roaming the world experience is good but fighting experience is much worst because cannot customise my action button i am a four finfer player but here i can use only two finger and the button are also very close to each other so most of the time cannot obtain desired output
2,i am giving this two stars because the loading takes way too long and when i get to the end of the data download it crashes every time and i have to redo it i give the extra star though because the game looks cool and the graphics look nice
2,i genuinely would play this game but until you guys allow my controller to even be an option i am not going to especially when my controller lets me play minecraft on my phone diablo immortals on my phone i can play multiple games that do not even require a controller on my phone i can use my controller for my phone itself without a game in use if all of those things are clearly capable being done it is clearly capable of you genshin impact being able to let me use my controller please fix
2,it just keep crashing even though i have more than enough storage space and got the lowest graphics on but it still keeps crashing the fps is on but the gameplay looks like it got one frame per three seconds and then crashes i cannot restart genshin because i do not have internet connection i only play genshin with data so mihoyo please fix this crashing issue
2,used to be a five star review now it is a two the game barely works on mobile and my game crashes when i try to wish before this was not even an issue and i could play normally but now my whole game experiences lag upon lag much too frequently to even call my gameplay fun i do not know why hoyoverse expects players to have top notch gaming equipment i am willing to play genshin but my device cannot handle it and buying a new one is not an option playing genshin feels like a hassle now
2,gameplay is good graphics are decent for mobile game is unfortunately glitched during the story mission cloud retainer i am unfortunately unable to offer the matuske meat rolls to finish the quest please fix asap i have been stuck in the same story mission for over a week now
2,it is has a good story and is very beautiful but may freeze on cutscenes the characters are interesting but pretty hard to get make stronger unless you have lots of paitence luck money the company try and get close with the community but seem to not listen more than half of the time it has alot of potential and is great artistically but is a very expensive game despite being free if it does not take your money it will take all your time it is the prettiest poison by far
2,the best parts are the exploration and the fighting mechanics but to get the best out of those you need to do unnecessarily huge amount of grinding i also feel like this came has the biggest identity crisis since it is trying to be rpg but none of the dialogue options affect the course the game rhythm game gacha game card game cooking game decoration game dating sim detective game and whatever they decide to pull of
2,if you cannot improve the rng on your artifacts at least make is it easier for us to finish artifact domains like having a quick battle option imagine logging in everyday for two years straight doing the same three domains only to get disappointing results it is becoming more of an errand now
2,gameplay gets sloggy they keep releasing enemies with massive invulnerability periods and half the game is tapping through unskippable dialogue aesthetics world and core gameplay are cool just super held back by all the chores also app size litterally too big to run anymore for me
2,ever since the last few updates it is impossible to play as it is constantly having to reconnect to server i will be in the middle of beating a boss and all of the sudden it has to reconnect and everything resets
2,no doubt the game is best but also boring and irritating too for those who do not like cut scene it take more time than gameplay i mean if you play ten minute of the game seven minutes will be the cut scene and you have to see whole story because there is no skip button
2,best thing which i like in the game is the low rewards even after playing for three years to top it all it is gigabyte in android mobile after installs there are so many new characters which keep coming that old characters do not get a re run banner so you can forget about getting constellationof your favourite four star character game is not balanced everything is rng luck artefact domain are really good it makes you feel you can almost get what you want genshin gets you addicted to gambling
2,okay so the game itself is awesome and i love it so much because of what i heard about it but when i came to open it for the first time on a new phone it said error because of lack of storage like i only had genshin and whatsapp installed and short video bruh really i could not even play it
2,all over game is so good i appreciate the genshin team for taking everything seriously and they are so much active but my humble request is to please increase the time for ascension quest two minute is not enough beat these monsters it is impossible i am stuck on that over a month please solve this issue asap please genshin
2,i truly cannot understand why it will not let me view my wish history i keep refreshing restarting and i even tried to delete my game but it still will not let me access my wish history it says could not connect try again later but i do not think my device or internet connection has a problem please help me cause i do not know what to do this game is very good anyway i liked the game style the amount of characters though it is very laggy if played on a random phone it is made for high graphics phone
2,its was fun at first but you run out of things to do pretty quickly and some of the dialogue recently has been questionable at least and racist at worst
2,i love this game it is so much fun but my only problem is it randomly crashes while i am playing and it always happens everytime i already tried fixing it by watching tutorials but it still crashes and now it will not let me in my screen would just turn black and it will then kick me out please hoyoverse fix it thank you
2,good game but it literally took me a goddamn days to just load it and there is still another loading screen like i waited for so long just for that to happen next time you wanna make a good game try to make the loading screen a little bit faster and shorter not it only loads in everytime
2,i had to wait over minutes to load textures shaders etc once that was complete i sat through the intro cutscenes and waited on a loading screen this loading screen would never finish i restarted the game and found that there is another one every time you boot up the game that one does not work either i do not know if it is a network or connection issue but if anything is able to be done please do it
2,i am experiencing a bug in the new map in erinyes forest it is like a pithole where you can find a hydroculous i am stuck their and the game blacks out and then restarts my phone i hope it will be fix soon
2,i do like the game but the problem is when playing in mobile since when downloading the files for a new update the more storage i have to delete more
2,i love playing it but i cannot anymore because it says i have too much storage after deleting some stuff it still says it i have almost completely have no games left because of it so what the hell
2,i have played this game with other devices but i havery cleared out a lot of stuff and its still not working i checked to see what is wrong but it is says it is using little storage and i do not know how to make it work i have gigabyte i storage left
2,the missions are monotonous there is like five minutes of dialogue for maybe a minute of gameplay the return on your gameplay feels terrible and it always feels like you are just short of being able to pull something when you spend money if the you can skip dialogue and cutscenes in the future i will rate higher not even worth opening the game up right now because it take longer to get through dialogue than it does to beat a mission
2,yeah i said that the game is amazing but it is killing my device i do not have enought storage for roblox i do and its bigger than you are game you just added the downloading resources stuff in you are game which takes to much storage you guys would probably lose all you are players by
2,the game overall is amazing it would be nice if the upgrading the statues of the seven did not cause me conflict with my religious beliefs as my religion is strictly monotheistic
2,after watching the special program and hearing the third year anniversary rewards i am so diappointed but not surprised hyv has been neglecting its genshin fanbase eversince with mediocre anniversary and special event rewards compared to its sister games like honkai star rail and hi third i just wish they would give loyalty rewards for players who have been active since version like me it would really make the playerbase especially those who stuck with the game through its highs and lows
2,when you first download it it is quite alright but hard to understand the game and how it works but as i said it was alright but when you reach level you will do not want to play it anymore and if you reach level you have to open common boxes to get only one wish if you collect wishes you can get a new character for me it a boring game and i do not recommend it to you
2,this game is amazing i love the characters but the loading always take extremely long even during updates it is also extremely lagging and poor quality on phone please do not make such big updates
2,the game is really good and all i played it in pc tablet and mobile and i want to address when are you guys going to add keyboard mouse and controller support on android please add it i need this feature
2,add controller support for android the mobile controls are so bad and uncomfortable lets us play with alternative controls if ios has controller support then why cannot android have it
2,i have known this game for a while now so a decided to try it out but despite having gigabyte of storage it tells me that i do not have enough insufficient storage no matter what i did i could not do anything i am seeing that i am not the only one with this problem
2,after the update i cannot send message to my friends anymore i having trouble can anyone help whats with this bug or i do not know guys i cannot open the text in game tob send to my friends
2,i really love this game it is the best game ever but after the recent updates the game does not start in my phone it stops showing loading game and it does not move further please help me i really want to continue it plsplspsps
2,the new daily system is bad only benefits people who have not done any exploration and if you are a veteran you can only use it on a few days before running out things to do and the fact that the points reset daily is bad make it weekly reset or better patch reset
2,best game but i cannot play when i go on my account it does not let me play the game because of insufficient storage please try again error code blah blah blah even though i had storage used i could not play the game for some reason please fix it i am begging you
2,i would like the genshin impact team to look at this matter i do not know why my genshin impact became blurry after reinstalling and after reinstalling picture quality is very bad even after setting graphic high please do something about it
2,i tried to play this game on a brand new android tablet oneplus pad and the intro sequence was so laggy i gave up on playing the game how can an android game run so terribly on brand new hardware
2,its fun but when it updates and i have to update it i have already make like megabyte and my storage were full then i uninstalled some of my apps and then it resets it turns back into megabyte that was like all gigabyte is all wasted
2,started lagging after the update i was not expecting any type of lag on my device but still the game is lagging alot after the last update please fix as soon as possible
2,the game is good but i am trying to make a registered account on gmail and a error appiered it says the current network environment is at risk and no verification code was send to me i do not know why and now i cannot make a new account to play hopefully this gets fixed so i can play in a new acc
2,well at first everything is fine i had so much fun playing the game untill i unlocked a teleport in fontaine the next day i stuck at the elements loading screen and when it reached the geo element my phone froze and everything start to lagging and the phone need to force stop i thought it was my internet connection but it was not so i deleted the game and install it back and the problem still there so i only rate it two out of five but if this problem fix i am gladly to give this game a five out of five
2,hello i want to tell you guys that this is one of the most best game in my favourite but i really hope that genshin developer please make it easy for me to play it without lag new download really make a pressure on my phone i am not rich nor the poor but please no add resource as i will gave me the negative impression on the gameplay i hope that genshin developer please solve this problem thank you
2,game is best but since yesterday my game was not open and my device get stucked after many tries i have to restart my device every time i open game after that my device work normally it is very disappointed that i was not able to play
2,why do i need to download again after updating the new version i have already downloaded gigabyte why after i update why do i need to download again from the beginning even though there is still gigabyte in my phone storage bug
2,drop rate is ridiculous in this games this games lack of security spend few thousand hours on this games and got hack by some russian not worth investing unless they have better security system
2,disappointment never disappear in terms of anniversary though a lot of story content but lack endgame content decent at best but never good enough
2,game is way too focused on whale players not everyone can pull one hundred wishes on every most banners fate points reset is by far the worst feature here makes me want to stop playing at all
2,hi i just want everyone to know that we are having a hard time entering the game not because of our phone but because of the new update of fontaine and i am really missing out i hope it will get fixed
2,if by chance i do not play this game for three to four days it just keeps on downloading for ten to minutes it is just so irritating
2,good game but sincerely hope game become less popular and more players quit so i can get higher chance to win limited reward from their contests more players mean less reward after all
2,why are your story quests so long why is everything so long and why does everything have to be done the hard way its honestly tiring listening to the storys we all know for a fact eveyone skips them
2,i love the graphics but my problem is why dose it talk to open all day i download it it was fast but now when i open it it have to download again ok its ok but like how it bad bad bad and i hate it i do not recommend it but if you want to see it fine
2,i love genshin impact and mostly play on pc with controller the mobile versions touch interface makes this infuriating to play moving the camera as you walk and attack is nigh impossible with the touch interface the story is pretty good the world building is crazy good music is quite good but the touch interface ruins it all if you have a pc go and play it there the game does have cross play and simply sign in with your hoyoverse account will move your save
2,the update is good all but i cannot but notice that the fps for this game has significantly drop it was as if i was watching a slideshow hope you guys optimize the game asap
2,genshin impact is an adventure rpg game with light cooperative capabilities the art the music the gameplay all exceptional this is why it pains me to give it a two star review monetization is harsh and the company gives no bundles for spending players everything is max costs old characters need to have some upgrades create augments like in hi for old character power boosts and new innovating gameplay needs a skip button for dialogue events are recycled and desperately need endgame content
2,its an amazing game very fun however i came accross a bug or glitch where i was exploring in fontaine but i randomly got kicked while exploring an underwater cave now i cannot log into my main account and it certainly is not a storage problem or phone problem because i can use my other account just fine please fix this bug i want to use my main acc
2,love this gameso much but i am upset android users seem to always have problems with the game lagging out horribly iphone can work without internet connection and does not lag once but an android cannot function genshin without internet connection for even five seconds before kicking you android has always lagged a bunch too i have tried three different androids that all lagged and would not function off of mobile data every iphone did not have even one problem
2,wish i would have never played two years ago if you are not on pc or ps it is not worth it not mobile friendly at all and the ps ps is region locked to your psn so like me my main is europe and i cannot play it on the ps which is a major reason why i am quitting the rates are not terrible for characters but the weapon banner is a major scam the gameplay was the only thing that kept me playing but the mobile is barely playable the pc bindings are terrible and the ps is region locked
2,the game itself is good and all but the only issue is it is space size i cannot really play in my android anymore i have gigabyte free space but to update megabyte i have to free up more space and in pc the size is already gigabyte what is this they should add past quest resources deletion in pc too and fix these android problems
2,i really love this game so fun and addicted i love everything about it this game is worth five stars but i have to give two stars for now after downloading version the game keep crashing it suddenly exit and i have to start again its pretty annoying when i am in a quest in fontaine it will crashed in a middle of video play so i have to do it again i cannot finish if it keep crashing please fix it and i will edit my review and rate it five stars ty
2,i do not like the gacha itself but the story is incredible even the character design it would be great to have a better dev team behind the game and rewards that fairly correspond to the dimension that the game has gained thanks to the community also the endgame is so simple it makes me think is this game just for casuals
2,please fix the ping issue after fontaine update the asia server ping always between to ms the delay was too much cannot get good game experience since can explore under sea world let alone challenge the abyss do not get me wrong fontaine was a good update since the sumeru issue hence please fix the high ping problem asap as i only have free time to play during night time
2,the game is the best with the graphic design and the every nation that it takes us for explore unfortunately i am getting pissed off due to the game keep crash resulting to i cannot even open the game i am not even explore fontaine yet seems like you will loss the number of players
2,pls allow to change server with data and progress i face issues with ping on european cannot play with friends and all please change this it would help a lot or else i have no reason to play the game i have to quit otherwise
2,i have been playing for a few days hours at a time the graphic are amazing the story is weak you come to a very slow crawl and not every quest has a good understanding unless you focus on the lore my main issue is character switching rather than group fights that is annoying items you get to progress are so clvast and rare is just unpredictable i love its concept and its free the giga it took to download kind of much as some details and dialogue definitely could have been avoi
2,the latency is awful in single player mode lots of effort has gone into the game but if they just improved what was already there it would be better time invested let us skip dialogue and cutscenes i understand it is story driven but the translational errors rip away any immersion controls really need work why not have a travel mode and a combat mode for mobile or have more intuitive climbing with no roots that inhibit any ambition to climb a surface it is not mobile friendly
2,extremely disappointing that it is been so long and controllers are still not supported on android as well as frame rates higher than i would play this game a lot more if i did not have to use on screen controller mapping
2,im not very happy with this game considering that the megabyte are very high taking almost all of my storage depsite it being so laggy it keeps glitching when i try to run and lags when i try to attack and it has to update every week or something that is very annoying i am thinking about uninstalling it because its a very unpleasant experience for me
2,stars on ios console or computer but on android stars lack of controller support makes it so infuriating to fight makes it even worse since i can push out higher graphics on a snapdragon gen makes it hella beautiful but unplayable because clunky onscreen controls instead of being able to use a controller
2,i waited more than two hours just to download this game but unfortunately it freezes before the game even started this is the first time it happened to my cp after so many games that i have tried there must be something wrong with this game i am absolutely disappointed
2,i am seriously disappointed i love everything about genshin but when i am finally able to download this game i need over something gigabyte and for what i am sorry to say but this game is becoming more and more inaccessible for every person who wants to play it if you want more people to play genshin please make it more acessable i cannot even download it on any of my other devices i would not recommend
2,played this game on my other phone since i hate the l li bait and the game is just overwhelming and money hungry it is fun but there is too much to do that you mentally become tired and stressed it is not like everyone that plays this game does not have a life and can do multiple quests for hours non stop also this game has its issues on its own and the fan base is even worse most of the adult characters look a lot like teens which is horrible and disgusting
2,this game is absolutely fantastic but the version is too much for my phone redmi note five and i cannot play it because it shows ‘insufficient storage and it is seriously annoying no matter how much i delete it says the same thing ‘insufficient storage i will give it five star once i can play it
2,an overall great game however i used a phone that has gigabyte rom and gigabyte ram and my phone is android version my phone is techno spark go by the way it does not show damage text and frozen water you can also find some players on hoyolab complaining about it so i really hope you fix this because as a student i cannot afford a better phone i would be a great help if you listen to us who has a potato phone welp i do hope you see this and you do something about it
2,legend of zelda breath of the wild but on phone and more anime aka probably the best thing ever but also the saddest thing because it becomes boring with this much content and no catch up to the story i fell behind on the main campaign and i am less motivated to catch up with it due to hours and hours and unskippable boredom
2,this is a wonderful game please do not play it the music the artsyle the combat the really cool charaters make it an amazing product in an awful gacha package new content is added bit by bit and bit was an exaggeration here what do you do in between updates you grind but cookie i do not want to grind i will just skip that well you want your cool characters right and you want them leveled up right in that case pay up hoyo controller support when
2,the game is great but storage is a big problem i have deleted all past quest resources and only have one language downloaded along with storage it is very easy to get burnt out later in the game the new fontaine update is leaving very little space on my phone
2,the new update has been taking a lot of time to load but now it just freezes once it has finished loading and exits the game just like that i love genshin but i am really frustrated because i have not been able to play for three days now
2,great game but the amount of storage space this requires is insane do you want only playstation and pc users to play because i have cleared my phone and my tablet of everything that i can and i still cannot even begin to download it and a lot of what other people i know have said they have the same problem you all need to fix this seriously
2,the dialogue in this game is too frequent and way too long it is also frustrating as you cannot skip dialogues and cinematics please add an option to skip both dialogues and cinematics
2,so the game is great and all i was playing the game and streaming it but i myself ran into a problem you cannot do character creation and customization and i did not realise till later that you had to pay to level a character and weapons items not to be honest that part got under my skin so i literally stopped mid stream and decided i would not stream the game do not get me wrong the game is great and i did enjoy it for a bit until i realized i was not making money in game so yeah
2,great game but bad qol lack of feature and boring repetitive grind fest of artifact the artifact always have bad stat on my account at least give us an option to skip the domain or sweep the domain and can use multiple resin condensed resin is outdated system for example aether gazer can use multiple swig in x run devs is too lazy to update the game and listen to community please listen to your large base of community there is a lot of complain and player burnout
2,still no controller support after years of waiting i do not think the developers care about android users at all the game is fun on console but a hassle on mobile the most recent events are unplayable on android
2,world is large enough to explore but lack that livelyness progession increase difficulty but not very rewarding cooperative is a welcoming function but it is pointles in this game also because it is gacha game many nicer things will be hidden behind a very high pay wall with no forgiveness overall gameplay is engaging and the soundtrack are great however mihoyoverse is very stingy so endgame will be very shallow to make player pull for characters it is basically their core practice
2,its an okay game but it takes gigabyte of storage already and wants me to free up gigabyte for their new update the storage has been an issue for a while and so many people have stopped playing because its not worth the storage and annoyance
2,the controls are finicky this game could be great if it was mobile controller friendly so i could use my clip on controller instead of the close mashed controls also the amount of load time and updates is excessive
2,poor gameplay and user interface for a gigabyte game cannot rearrange buttons buttons do not respond nice content and story though developer responded quickly nice please do provide possibility of moving buttons hands and screen sizes differ
2,the exploration and main story are five stars the side stories are three stars the character visual design is four stars and their gameplay is two stars they keep making four star characters very focused on either supporting two or less characters in the entire roster or part of an unpopular niche such as physical dps
2,i wonder what is in the end of story of twin how many years does i spend playing this game maybe its to far from this day maybe do i wish to easily get a rare artifact even in one rare artifact in just one month i will be happy with that but i spent a year but i aint got a good perfect one why is that hoyo and also very poor server in ph even i have a good network
2,the game is fun but i really wish the drop rate was improved i wanted the get the characters but the pulls are so bad the wishing system is bad i do not wish to spend so much to get a character i get nothing but weapons and maybe just maybe a character this needs to be improved a little
2,genshin is a fun open world game with a ton of fun things you can do you can battle explore play with your friends etc however the amount of storage this hame takes up my phone is nearing gigabyte due to the new regions and updates it requires its players to download do not get me wrong the lore and story makes it worth it but i think mihoyo should limit the amount of gigabytes needed for mobile players to download i love the game but many people quit because of this exact reason
2,super fun game incredible graphics but almost unplayable on mobile it eats up so much space that it has to be the only app on your phone i really wish i could rate it higher but i have to at least be able to open the game edit cognosphere has recommended i look at the website for recommended specs on this game the website requests eight gigabyte of space but the current version of the game the only version you can download takes around gigabyte not sure how the website helps with that
2,i give a two stars because when i play it i do not have enough storage i think i do can you please fix it and i when i keep playing it keep saying i do not have a storage
2,the games frame rate suddenly drops making the combat system harder than it should be i play on a gigabyte data phone i would also appreciate if sand physics were added to mobile
2,uhm it is looks fun to play then i downloaded after i log in then i have a problem to the downloading the map i have tried multiple times
2,awesome game but a lot of pay to play the pity system is terrible and will probably not let me build the teams i want instead i try to play with the team i have got sending couple of of dollars will set anyone up very well free to play options is available but guess that is just a minimal thing if you do not spend even a penny on the game update after playing for a long time i quit this game because it was just making no sense as the catch up is too much if you discontinued for a week
2,with the hype dying down i see that the developers still choose to ignore the sentiments of the players about the game some of which that comes to mind are limited resin for the growing number of domains limited end game content spiral abyss and stupidly biased rng in artifact farming it even gets infuriating when we consider that their other game wherein these similar features are properly recognized and addressed by the developers despite of its status as a newly launched game
2,the third anniversary reward of genshin impact is not satisfactory at least for us the feature chooses five stars in the standard banner or it is better to add daily resin like the honkai star rail game will not it
2,having issues with the game today as the buttons are not working cannot use the fighting moves nor speed run up the cliff was working fine this morning but out of nowhere it was doing that
2,i mean i like the game but it is too much it added like shaders physics and wasted a lot of storage
2,seriously what the f i have gotten qiqi four times now i do not even dislike her at first and this would not seem bad if i were a whale but i do not make five star pulls often she is my only standard character that is a chance of that happening i would rather win the lottery with those odds if i get her again i am changing my rating to one
2,the game is good yes but when you are playing on a phone it is much harder the graphics and all the cutscenes can be too laggy and it kind of ruins the galing experience and their is a bug on some characters dvalin like those where their texture is messed up like they are not on the right shape it is like their bodys being pulled almost everywhere i uninstalled tje gale because i could not get pass on beating dvalin because of those bugs and i am hoping that thosr would be fixed
2,i wanted to open a new account in america server in the opening cut scene the cut scene stops but the subtitles still goes on and they ask me to select a sibling how can i select it the cut scene stopped in the beginning i tried for three times and it is still the same please help me with this issue i just want to open a new account agh
2,story is really good character designs are really good too but where the hell is quality of life sleep for last four year honkai star rail was launched months ago and there has already added stuff that every genshin player had asked for in last four years why development team of this game is so bad i just cannot believe it they do not even care all they care about is making money instead of listening to there player base request i hope after looking at honkai star rail development team is team learns something
2,poor incentive reward system only things keeping it alive are the characters and the map update high resource storage consumption no gameplay optimisation since the release of the game and still unable to customise controls
2,play this game if you want to have to read an entire page ya novel in between every gameplay moment no skipping allowed
2,good game but is an absolute storage hog do not get it unless you have a device that is only for it that is how much space it takes because they refuse to optimize the game it plays well and the characters are gorgeous along with the story line i do recommend it but for mobile players and tablet players next update will likely up so much space to the point i will not be able to play at all
2,good game but npcs talk too much and quests running from npc to the next are way too long
2,treat smartphones as pc because there are many ways to play games on android these days its give players options like you can switch from touchscreen to controller or even mouse and keyboard because any that usb can connect there should not be any restrictions based on specific devices if ios can have support then all android devices should have support as well there is not any difference between the two types
2,the game exceeds all expectations of a free to playgame the voice acting is incredible the animations are gorgeous and the world is so big bug in cooperative i cannot enter dungeons even after meeting recommended level requirements around adventure rank progress slows dramatically stars this is a soul sucking game with a chance at hero and not enough variety to keep it interesting gameplay becomes repetitive with endless fetch quests it was fun while it lasted
2,played it off and on for about two years now love the story art music ect but the amount with the new upcoming update is insane and there still is a lot of new updates coming at least one per year for next years with this update coming up it would take up a whole gigabyte on the phone making it just not practical to have on phone anymore unless i just deleted everything else on my phone once again it is not practical
2,i used to rate this game five stars but lately it has been quite laggy the loading screen will load in correctly up until the geo symbol where it would sometimes glitch from half to full there are a few times where the games ost would play in the background but it would still display the laggy loading screen even after i tried uninstalling and reinstalling it still had the same problem i hope this issue is fixed soon
2,beautiful game visually although it fails to keep players hooked and becomes an absolute nightmare to new players it is not well paced at all and it is easy to become bored or burnt out nowadays the updates have become huge there is no way to find any more space on my pc for this and to think there are regions still coming in the future please find a way to lower the number of gigabyte it is insane
2,i really love genshin but there is a big problem that needs to be addressed and i feel like the devs know but are too busy bathing in money ironically this resolution could give the company more money updating their standard banners to include more five stars or adding additional banners for newcomers and others who do not want to pull on limited banners secondly it truly feels like the devs do not care for us the players as each anniversary proves that with their meager rewards to thank us
2,the story in general is very childish and rushed could have been better the characters are entertaining but the wishing system is very addictive
2,the game overall is good but there is some problem with logging in even though i remembered my password and it was already saved it is showing there is error my internet connection is also good and when i tried to create a new password and login in it reseted it and now i lost all my progress this is something you guys really need to improve so for that only two star from me i would have given four or five but then because of this issue i uninstalled it and only two star
2,the last update seems and feel like very havy for my device now i do not know but the previous version of the game my device can handle it but now not so much so i am going to uninstall it now thanks for the good times bye bye
2,after this recent fiasco i cannot support this game anymore tons of unfixed bugs that hinder the player while fun glitches are fixed immediatly their solution censor everything from chat to profile message and their mods on all websites and discord are working overtime there is also the fact that artifact rng is fixed i had fun with this game but the more you play it the more you realise how many things are wrong with it droping to since its third year of dissapointment for anniversary
2,when i first download it in it runs smoothly on my phone barely even crash but now the update is too big uses too much space and even heavy that everytime i tried to play it but it crash i never get the chance to play and i deleted it because it cause my phone lag so much please do not make the app too heavy
2,the game is amazing but it does not reward their long time players also the lack of end game combat contradicts the gameplay
2,very fun game i only wish for more freemogems the game updates frequently and it has plenty of events update for being a game supported by players for three years we should be getting more then of a five star and some extra things the other games by hoyoverse give a free five star and gacha games only do well with the support of the players even if they do not give a free five star at least give more pulls even if it is for standard because that will satisfy players more then pulls on limited
2,character designs are amazing combat playstyle is great overall this game is a the reason i gave it a two star is because it takes too much storage space i have tried reinstalling several times and uninstalling it again but it is no use i deleted almost all of my photos and cleared my cache but it did not let me enter the game i am just stuck at the loading screen where it says insufficient space please fix this issue
2,u see the problem is this game is pay to win or pay to be happy bcs i grind so much to get that character work hard to it and i got a disappointment of you like me to play just please fix the wishing system
2,honestly seeing the overall reviews here mine is going to be an antagonist the open world gaming is amazing but to be honest at some point they designed the game a way to overbearing you constantly checking in for domains dailies trying to get artifacts roll them and get frustrated again to enter domains spiral abyss specifically event character orientated so if you are trying to get a full please just stop plus they are so stingy with the rewards omg it has been like this for years
2,the virtual joystick for moving your character around is about an inch further towards the center than where your thumb would naturally rest so up means left and then middle of the screen is forward on top of that it is choppy and stuttery on the lowest graphical settings i installed it at a minute and was able to play it at p minute it took well over three hours i am incredibly disappointed and i want my three hours back
2,i have a request i have small storage and my phone is samsumg i want to play this game but my storage enough to download resources finish it its so big gigabyte please change it
2,so i downloaded the game but it would not let me actually play the game because everytime i logged in it said that there was an error
2,the game crashes too much i cannot even get sec in without it doing so requires way too much storage space to play over time i have to uninstall all my other apps just to attempt to play it
2,the security in this game needs fixing my one year adventure rank account got hacked even though i only shared my info about my account on my close friends and i cannot even get it recover
2,i was once able to play genshin on my chrome book but after the sumeru update i was unable to get pass the loading screen and after the fontaine update was still not able to open the game i had to delete and reinstall it but in doing so i was no longer able to get in game and everytime it loads i am unable to get past the applying of shaders my chromebook is able to run many games that are pc and there is never an issue so if this is downloadable on chrome book it should be playable
2,it is just been one week since i played genshin impact due to exams and now i cannot get inside it says account or password problem and now i cannot play the game
2,really after updating to only needs like gigabyte on my phone after download it i left it for a second and update gigabyte hoyoverse you are truly scammers
2,i wish we can change our saved data to other server like i want to change my saved game to asia server because in playstation it is auto america server but my friends is in asia server and i cannot join them
2,the story is very good but it keeps crashing every second and gets disconnected at the most crutial moments the gaming experience is terrible with this issue
2,great exploration great combat my one major complaint ís they insist on forcing their lengthy cutscenes on you despite this being a pick up and play mobile game they refuse to add a skip cutscene button and it is infuriating they do not respect me or my time whatsoever i only have a few minutes to play here and there but each time i play i get essentially a minute of playtime and ten minutes of unskippable cutscenes for how long this game has been out it is clear they do not care at all
2,still no controller support for android i will pass at this point there is no excuse for this other then some shady deal in play with apple
2,love it but it is a lot of grinding and i wished it did not take so much to make it look nice lol its ok though my phone is a little on the older side edit wanted to play it again so i had to delete so many apps and files to be able to dl it not sure if imma keep it long since it kills my battery and heats it up too
2,may you fix this app please or i am reporting because i cannot play its saying i have storage which was i already deleted everything and it is still popping up on my screen please fix this app i would would give this a zero star but i cannot fix it please and thank you id enjoy your game if you did it has to be fix by tomorrow or today if you can please i really want to play this i think it is a cool game love you all guys
2,i saw the add of the game and it looks very fun because i like exploring i instal it but the game takes to much time to downloading that is the reason that i gave two stars please fix this problem
2,could not register using email address it really forcing you to use either google facebook or twitter to register i do not have facebook or twitter account and i definitely not going to use my google account to register until this issue fixed two stars for this game period
2,i am from india new delhi the ping is always high like to but after playing this game from the start i was not seeing any problem related to ping but from few months now the ping have became to and the game delay because of it i thought that my internet connection connection have problems but it is working perfectly with other app and games please fix this problem asap it is hard to do abyss because of it
2,i do not know what happened but after the update my game got stuck on update screen and it keep asking to download megabyte of data again again i really wish this get fix cost in case of storage i still got quite a lot so i do not know the issue here if it is my phone or what please fix it developers
2,the game has used gigabytes on my phone friends tell me that its only ish gigabytes however when i tried to continue downloading the resources it says that i have insufficient storage i have nine gigabytes left on my phone i am confused how it says that its insufficient fix this bug please
2,this game is amazing but the new update completly crashed my game i cannot get past the loading sceen before it boits me out on my laptop i have tried everything and still nothing please fix this it is getting very annoying that i can basically not play anymore
2,the game is perfect but i am really sad really sad cos i have played this game for like hrs a day to collect premogems its a type of money in game by completing mission the only problem is after all this hard work when i wish for character i fails all time i spin like times for my favorite character wanderer but i failed to get and lost all premogems please decrese the wish amount like to half or something i do not have money to buy premogems please this is a request from my heart please
2,we need to buy primo or fates with mora i can barely do anything in the game now because i do not have cooperative because of the ritou escape plan quest i have lost all motivation and patience with genshin now i cannot even go in my serinitea pot unless i do the quest i emailed and nothing was changed now i am even more stressed and having even more breakdowns because of it please at least give my cooperative and serinitea pot back this game is one of my only ways to destress and now it is not working
2,the lack of exploration tools aside from characters with certain niche makes the exploration a lot more time consuming also certain events or at least modes are much less rewarding compared to the difficulty it has and it seems it is not being properly addressed the developers which makes doing these challenges seem more like a punch to the face for dollar last the story telling quality seems to rushed especially the dendro archon quest as it had much less lore and more excessive explanations
2,the open world experience is notable for a mobile game exploration can be fun and rewards are often given for careful searching genshin is at its best in the early mid game late game seems to be mostly grinding instances for ideal equipment stats and challenge content instance rewards are limited by a time based currency challenge content rewards some premium currency but often requires premium teams to earn the full amount probably better on pc console
2,very cheap rewards primo including other resources and after a year no anniversary in game event or rewards given does primo counts as anniversary reward
2,nah matter of fact fu this game to be honest this is so bad when it comes to luck like losing more than winning em not getting a single good artifact even after spending resins like its freakin resins man that is a lot and it should be enough to build like at least characters but in this game it is even enough to build one character decently like if you ok with spending resins which take like hrs to get your daily limit which is damn it man to get a meh build that is on you
2,little content to be the reason to build and pull new character i hope every region have it is own challenge just like honkai star rails forgotten hall like at luofu
2,extremely addictive and fun when you start playing after a while everything is boring repetitive it is extremely difficult to build characters you have to learn all this stuff just so you can survive in the game i do not have the kind of money to buy primo to get five star weapons in order to do good damage not to mention archon quests are literal torture tapping the screen to get through pointless dialogue honestly i began hating this game
2,this game is very good but but am dying achse this new update is talking a very long time it is still please do something if you can
2,this game puzle is just stupid expecially the archon quest puzle and world quest i just hate it did not even give any clue
2,my dude please make this game playable to much of a resource download and some of the devices are not compatible with game fix all that please i saw my cousin play a while back i thought it was fun but resource downloading is to much for me to play game so could you mind fixing that for others
2,a very fun and pretty good game but it takes up way too much space on my phone the app itself takes up gigabyte there is also other on my phone which takes up a whole lot of space which i am just gonna blame this game for that because i cannot think of anything else it would be after the most recent update which added sumeru the game has been crashing so much i have set the graphics lower which allowed me to play for maybe minutes but then it started crashing almost every ten minutes again
2,a really good game i really enjoy genshin a lot and its easy to be free to play and avoid microtransactions with a bit of luck and grinding most of the events give the currency you use to buy more wishes for free so spending money is not required to have fun even in late game however i strongly recommend using pc or playstation instead mobile is incredibly frustrating to play on as its very demanding for the device and the controls are not the best if possible avoid playing this on mobile
2,it is very fun once you start out but as you keep progressing there is gradually less and less to do as a late game player there are very limited ways to get primo other than buying them in addition to this since there are very little new quests there are about minutes of content every day the resin system is also very discouraging since you can only do a limited number of domains and do not get me started on the drops the game could be easily improved
2,played on pc verdict awesome from the sound dialogues and the anime esque artstyle everything is just awesome the challenges are pretty varied just like the various characters a large emphasis is laid on combining different elements fire electro cryo etc ps camera is better on pc on android mobile camera work is bad the camera keeps changing rotating along with zooming into the character whenever it wants this becomes terribly annoying especially while fighting enemies two star
2,many things about this game are great examples are the graphics gameplay and most of the lore the biggest issue is that with the representation of characters within certain regions doesnt feel like they were designed the way they were supposed to for those who get it get it another very large issue is that if you are an active player past the level of adventure rank and beyond there is not much content left for you to do if you are someone that likes to complete what they can even with events
2,a pretty solid game i can understand the hype but there is one problem the bugs on low end devices are horrible i do not really mind terrain glitching or characters not loading in well but i have been stuck on the mondstadt archon quest where you confront dvalin in his lair there is an annoying glitch with the model that make dvalin look like a geometrical mush of colors that cover the entire screen i am adventure rank something and reached liyue but i cannot even progress the story quest
2,the art style and music and world building in this game is phenomenal and the combat is fun if only a little restrictive due to how little resources are given in the game however what truly diminishes the joy of the game is how poorly the players feedback have been heard or even acknowledged and the growing list of qol changes and bugs that continue to be left unattended to that along with a recent spate of poorly designed character kits has driven me away until things change
2,seemingly a good game but the fact you do not have controller support on android after so many years tells me you do not want people to play your game it exists on pc and ios to my understanding and there is even a menu to select input type but for whatever reason you refuse to add it in game size is far too bloated for something you have to play on touchscreen just not worth keeping
2,it is a very fun and enjoyable game at first after maybe a week of playing you completely run out of things to do in the world and the only real repeatable content is locked behind the resin system which is basically just stamina from other mobile games you only get max resin and everything costs between resin per run the game quickly turns into one where you log on spend your resin in minutes then log out genshin has a lot of potential and i just hope it is fixed
2,great exploration with breath of the wild like systems and better combat imo it becomes a lot less fun once you stop exploring or doing quests and start getting into endgame territory doing the same dungeon times in a row is not all that fun especially since the dungeons are essentially just fighting arenas once you know how to beat it it just becomes tedious also the anniversary rewards suck
2,it deserves five stars for the first levels but about every system and event that is build in is absolute garbage it makes it very hard to play it on a daily basis as that is not what the game feels like it makes you feel like you want to get lost in it but then it just starts to limit about every single thing you would want to do like flying before noticing suddenly you cannot anymore very dissapointing
2,i am sorry to change the review but there are two reasons excluding anniversary rewards the monotonous gameplay the game is really amazing when it comes to story etc but after a while it gets boring especially at higher levels there are just daily commissions and a few bosses to kill after that there is nothing to do unless you have all the time in the world it just feels like we are stuck in a loop taking the player base lightly this is both related and is not to anniversary rewards the players were disappointed with the conclusion given to the inazuma archon quest but there was no response the players are complaining about anniversary rewards and again there is no response what so ever
2,the combat is fast and fluid and handles multiple enemies better than the witcher three or dark souls your character simply attacks the nearest enemy and you are free to move around the battlefield the graphics are gorgeous there is freedom of exploration and so many things to find there are many little puzles and challenges dotted around this game is a masterpiece and it is free however after a couple weeks there is no more content to explore and only farming remains
2,on the surface this is a five star game that should cost sixty dollars upfront due to its expansive world and excellent gameplay with tight controls and intuitive combat reminiscent of xenoblade however the story and world are far from complete attempting to reach post story progress goals will lead to an exponentially longer grind that has to be spread out over days or weeks because of an energy system that cannot be completely expedited even with hundreds of dollars
2,it is necessary to admit that the core game is rather good but it is overhype lots of exploration and fun intuitive gameplay however the endgame is simply bland it is constant grind you are also quick to realise there is little of a challenge in the game also the characters are pretty much identical once you get a couple of ss tier five stars it is not necessary to invest in other characters anymore pc body types are two for males and three for fm also the in app prices are horrendous story dumb
2,it is a great game with an interesting story the graphics and sound is decent and you can also pretty much do everything as a free to play user if you would like with that being said the way the updates trickle in and the lack of endgame makes it lacking once you have done what is available with the recent anniversary events and just the overall way the community is treated by the developers it is not worth giving this more than a
2,it is slow no matter how many storage you have or how good you internet connection is do not get me wrong it is a very good game but it keeps crashing and the environment models looses texture half the time and i am not sure if it is just me but the last time it crashed my whole tablet kept turning on and off and i had to power it off then try to make it work thankfully it is alright now
2,recently i have only been getting a black screen when i load up the game on my phone
2,too much grind unlike other gacha games still no controller support
2,it is always stuck on checking update after upgrade version damn
2,add controller support with the backbone controller
2,my dude please make this game playable to much of a resource download and some of the devices are not compatible with game fix all that please i saw my cousin play a while back i thought it was fun but resource downloading is to much for me to play game so could you mind fixing that for others
2,the game is awesome but i just hate the fact that i cannot see the damage text please fix this
2,when i first got the game when i put all the stuff in it took hours just to load so i gave it a star
2,the game restarted to the beginning please fix it
2,please hoyo i am begging you to lower the rng system on artifacts its too time consuming and frustrating to farm
2,the external game download for genshin in windows is very slow please fix it
2,the game needs eight gigabyte on android i never be able to play it
2,it my system user interface keeps crashing i just want to know whats happening
2,it hurts me so much that i have been playing this game for months and did not get a single five star when literally my friend who just played it a week ago got a five star mona and i just draw earlier and ofc i got collie who i already have i literally saved that forty sixsix primogens for five days please you all better give me a reason to not delete your game
2,hello hoyoverse after i updated my genshin impact it will not let me use my email and keeps saying login failed
2,i honestly love the game but from on today why why is everything sensored me damage crit long i cannot even say a word without it being messed up because it is sensored please fix this its turning into roblox but worse
2,i have waited sixhrs and i cannot play the game my router is perfectly fine and no problems with good connection and i even uninstall and install repeatedly and i cannot enter the game it says error forty yet my other games that require internet connection did not have this problem only genshin it sounds like you do not want me to play your game which is truly unfortunate because i enjoyed it before such a shame here is for making my game experience worse a star bad review for you and i am from asia server
2,this game clearly has a lot of heart put into it with what could be an interesting plot and interesting characters but the main story quest is such a bore with hours and hours of unskippable dialogue that all seem to amount to the same thing and little actual gameplay in comparison sometimes you are forced to do character quests in addition which also have way more dialogue than necessary if there was a skip button to skip entire scenes maybe it would be a bit better
2,i have been playing since release and the gameplay is what keeps me playing what i do not enjoy is hours and hours of dialogue you have to go through with the story quests please give a skip button for this i have never played a game that does not have a skip option for cutscenes i have requested this multiple times through survey feedback and nothing gets done everything else is great but it gets annoying when you just want to play the quests without dialogue and cutscene interruptions
2,the story lines are interesting characters design are fantastic therere many places to explore the events are okay the sceneries are absolutely breathtaking overall the game is fine i would definitely recommend others to play it the problems i have with this game is that it took way too many storage space not only that it is really laggy and the screen would sometimes freeze it is really annoying please fix it
2,at its best it is one of the best mobile game experiences in terms of depth the map is incredibly big and the graphics are quite mind blowing at first my problems with it are with the predatory monetization the long winded unskippable dialogues and the abysmal performance especially on android devices even on flagship devices such as the samsung galaxy ultra even after lowering settings and optimizing my device as much as i could the game was unplayable after a couple of minutes
2,lack of diversity i have been playing this game for almost years daily it has a good overall experience things to offer however an issue that is been here from the start and has become more obvious with new releases is that it lacks diversity skin tones body shapes weapon styles and more are very very lacking we as a community have been saying this for almost years yet get no response and are ignored or flagged aside from these issues being problematic it is just bad designing
2,music is awesome graphical style and design is also lovely however gameplay is mostly not that interesting and quite often rich of repeating the same actions over and over again monetization model is also not great it is quite awful and kind of a style for games like that even more the map is still in development and optimization became worse since two point zero update i cannot recommend genshin if you are not ready to pay a lot of money to make it fun to play or if you are aint willing to grind
2,the game is good and it has potential to be great but after nearly years of playing it next to nothing has been changed still got the same old boring routine if you do not count the artifact farming and dailies there is no endgame besides abyss events are always temporary never permanent with which i do not have a problem with but some of these events for example the hide and seek one could make a great permanent feature in the game edit i wanna say more but there is not enough space left
2,great game i play it on pc all the time the android version had an extreme oversight though in that there is absolutely no controller support the drop down to change from touchscreen to something else is there but nothing shows up honestly pretty disappointed by that because the touchscreen controls are really bad will update if they ever change this but for now i am sticking to pc
2,i am not seeing any change whatsoever after a year and a half of the games release sadly the resin lock makes artifacts too hard to farm and it is even more frustrating that they are so random it is hard to level up all the characters you want as well maybe if they were a bit more generous and gave out more fragile resin from quests and events or hell even as an abyss reward the experience would be better it is a shame because the world building is very nice
2,finally playing on playstation the game needs contrast on a phone it is a little easier to see stuff than on playstation but only because you are physically closer to the screen the colors all sadly blend together so it is quite hard to tell whats what but it looks super nice just hard to see details so far great game just needs some color adjustment update the storyline does not make any sense
2,this game use to be my favorite i loved everything about the game the graphics challenges art especially the free adventure roaming over time as my world level goes up the game gets harder but does not give you enough boss drops to get to the next accession rank so you end up getting hit with more damage then needed i loved when the new island arrived the art and culture is amazing but you dony get access to such power ups because of your level being too low so you miss out on stuff
2,i played the game pretty solidly for a while even paid for several of the monthly subscriptions and battle passes but the thing that absolutely broke me were the artifacts i have no problem with a grind i have no problem with a time sink but few things feel quite as disheartening as working for several months on a goal of improving a single characters artifacts and feeling like zero progress has been made after so long
2,good quality but the story is progressing awfully slowly for a game where there is nothing to do most of the time everything buyable is expensive rewards for doing in game tasks are very small after a while it becomes more work than fun which games are supposed to be i still play for the pretty graphics animations and familiar voice actors but i do not know how long that will last unless some significant changes are made
2,very poorly optimized my phone immediately heats up just from loading it it does not do this with other heavy apps i can barely stay on it for less than five minutes until i get a black screen and am kicked out from the game loading times incredibly long i have spent more time on loading screens than actually playing it it is a shame because it looks really good regarding world building art and character design may try installing it again at a later date maybe it works then
2,the game graphics and combat system is great however the adventure rank requirements for the next missions are very annoying not only that but obtaining primo and getting good characters takes too much time that not a lot of people have the drop rates for the heroes are extremely low i spent fifty and got absolutely nothing good in return now i only play this game at least once a week for at least five minutes
2,can barely condense my resin game is constantly freezing crashing etc even on lowest graphic settings now i do not have the newest phone but it is up to date and has no problems with other games i just wish there was an app where i could preview my account and condense resin so i can use later when i have time on pc instead of having to log into this app to do anything for it to inevitably crash within a minute
2,honestly one of the best rpg mobile games i found i live the story and the characters and animation i would give it a higher rating if it was not for the fact that the game keeps crashing i got to level six then as i would run or fight normal enemies it would start to freeze up and crash i tried cleaning my phone cache and made more space for the game i even uninstalled and installed again but it continues to crash so i just gave it and finally uninstalled it completely
2,it is a gorgeous game with amazing graphics engaging characters and a beautiful storyline but there is a glitching sound during the cutscenes and whenever a character speaks that makes the game unplayable and unpleasant not sure what causes the issue but it ruins the game for me i hope there is a support team i can contact i am not sure if the issue is my phone or the game
2,the game is really gorgeous and has good exploration and some other fun features however awful and highly unstable performance along with constant disconnections make it impossible to enjoy after the november update the stability and performance are momentarily better and less catastrophic e giga reconnections are short and less frequent but the situation quickly decays indicating perhaps a memory leak please continue to build on the progress you have made by fixing the disconnections
2,game looks lovely controls need work i did not get passed the tutorial as i had much difficulty getting used to the controls tried searching the options for a way to invert the on screen controls and realized that genshin impacts devs had not thought of this i will wait for a while and hope such a rudimentary option gets included in the next update
2,graphics and pretty neat but i had to rate it low because they did not have inverted controls i play my games with the x axis inverted it is very difficult for me to train my brain to play it other way around please developers add the option to invert the y and x axis would have been a five stars if they had the option now it remains almost unplayable for me
2,the gameplay is great controls need to be reworked implementing a idle and a combat interface would be a good idea stealth kills are a good idea too and a crouch button and as well as an evasion button it is a good idea to implement options to change the interface to personal liking because whenever i turn my camera i am able to accidentally press and hold the attack button another thing is the camera just moving by itself when in combat i get headaches just from the weird angles it has
2,the game has great graphics and story but is frustrating to play without a controller which is not currently supported on android for some reason while fighting or exploring the world i would rate this app much higher if it did it plays much much better on playstation with a controller or pc with mouse and keyboard
2,well i was gonna give this a game a good review it had good graphics i love the open world good music too but now everytime i launch the app and begin the game now it freezes on the loading screen and waiting is not helping and re downloading it does not fix the problem i have tried the other options that usually help but no so i guess it was nice while it lasted which was not even a whole day really a disappointment so thanks for wasting six hours of my life
2,this game is incredible in terms of open world exploration but the combat gameplay is straight up dysfunctional however good the game is the combat cannot make up for it mobile is terrible for gameplay pc is too complex and console straight up destroys your fingers the amount of money someone needs to spend on the game just to get a single character is terrible this game is just an overrated cash grab that pulls in players using overrated characters that people simp for
2,the files are too large for me to actually play anymore it was a fun game when i could play it but now i cannot unless i delete everything please fix this so people can actually play it i want to be able to play it and actually have a nice time as well as having my other apps besides all that the game is really fun and colorful and i would definitely give it a better rating once the file thing is fixed thanks for reading
2,hope it requires little less storage it required almost gigabyte in android phone even if we remove audio package and old quest file hope they can optimize the game a little it has good graphic and story too but i have only the storage issue
2,when i downloaded this it is only megabyte but when i open it and start to play it will be take megabyte oh my god how can i downloaded it
2,a great game at it is core that does not respect your time absurd lengths to wait for certain characters and weapons to rerun with no justifiable reasons behind it qol improvements are scarce and there is a massive list of community complaints and requests that have never and likely will never be addressed the longer you invest in this game the more you will realize that there are a multitude of problems that could easily take precedent and be resolved but simply have not
2,i could not login to my account via facebook can you fix this bug i do not want to loose my acc
2,the game is great and all but i have been having problems with logging in like i have to try at least minute before i can get in to the world and when i do after playing a while it is glitching and kicks me out of the game and it is reaslly annoying i cannot even play minute a day please lemme know how to fix it
2,how do you connect the xbox wireless controller
2,it is a really fun game but i just spent three hours on exploration of the new four two region one of them is at and the other at i upgraded fontaines statue to max level of the current version did events and quests all i got was eight pulls all that for freaking eight pulls do not be so cheap please everyone is tired of endless grinding and farming just to lose their s
2,i wasted a lot of money on this game and used to play it seven but my old phone ended up breaking and when i got a new one there was not enough storage for the app i had to leave my comfort game and all the characters i worked hard for behind i hope mihoyo can fix this game because it takes up my entire phone and computer but now i cannot even play it you guys are losing players from this and the fact this game is not even halfway complete and it is already over megabyte is a problem
2,reason way this is two star rating the game is really good reminds me of zelda but the game starts to skip and freeze a lot after maintenance a few days and the game keeps kicking me your update messed up the gameplay my pc and my phone it no longer plays smoothly and it freezes every ten minutes and kicks me out i hope you can fix this i really like this game
2,amazing game still cannot believe this is free to play one of the best games you could play right now using a mid range up to a high end mobile device edit uninstalling it now in nov after four two patch dropped it was a fun game for a long while
2,boring minim konten end game gampang di hack gampang dibobol cheat dev kikir padahal revenue gede tapi ngasih hadiah anniversary gak ada wah wah nya sama sekali please separate tcg from the main game tcg is useless no use no benefits no primo like spiral abyss
2,constant content drought and bad artifact systems makes this game fairly boring
2,in beginning it is interesting and when you reached level and above story becomes poor and i will recommend not to download this game
2,i was so excited to play this game but when i downloaded it it said it will take up gigabyte of space i did not mind as i had gigabyte left but it was taking hours and hours to load and when i was so close to playing it it said something went wrong and brought be back to the start i was so mad and wanted to throw my phone across the room and i was patient and did the loading thing again but the same thing happened please do smth about this i have played it on my frns phone and it fun thank u
2,nice game but livestream code have shot time to redeem that does not long enough to hr why at least hr many other game giveaway seem they intent on giving more that this
2,this game is a sickness worse than that of covid it will suck away all your time and ifyou are prevy to it all your money too i found myself trying to justify my investment onto the game by trying to indoctrinat my friends into it telling them all how good a particular character is knowing all too well if they wanted it they would have to spend it was a well made game with the ever increasing goal of getting you hooked on the game and feeling grateful for it legit mind control
2,they should add more space in resins when we reach adventure rank and above because it is not enough
2,i want to log in to the second account but he writes too many requests please try again later how do i want to play again on my second account please answer i bought a sec account with money not using a leaf
2,uh i really liked this game it was fun and i love how big the world itself is unfortunately i recently uninstalled it out of pure annoyance it takes up a lot of space and when i was trying to to a quest it would freeze my phone completely and i would need to restart it which sucks because genshin takes so long itself to load
2,once you become stronger it sucks its not a game that i expected no fun at all the cooperative sucks
2,i really love this game but cannot get it to load without crashing
2,make the story or dialogue skippable then five stars way too long way too draggy
2,why do you guys favor honkai star rail and hi more you guys literally included features we were begging to include in genshin for a year in honkai star rail and its blatant you guys probably use most of the revenue you get to improve the other two it is just baffling how little you care about the game and refuse to hire good devs like the other two i love this game i really do but it is painful when you ignore your community
2,if you want to put two five star weapons in one banner with a choice but the gacha still gives a five star weapon that i did not choose it is better you just throw away your choice setting thank you
2,im not able to log in to my account it is logged in hoyoverse but keep on saying invalid account format can anyone resolve my issue
2,the amount of time it takes to complete the story compared to the old chapters is baffling the rewards are not even that good you get like primo for five hours of gameplay playing this game feels more like a chore now than ever i get it that this game is targeted at casual players but i do not think anyone would want to go through the prison act in fontaine again
2,game itself is really cool but i could never get the controller i preferred to work with the game i have checked some forms and tried everything all the other games i use it for work fine if i ever figure it out i will update but i do not wanna use the touch screen to play it is really the only issue
2,the download resource took forever but the loading screen is beautiful
2,it will not let me play it keeps saying storage thing but all my videos and games are gone
2,with the new updates i have not been able to play this game as it takes to much storage and even if i have enough storagei am not able to play with how much it glitches
2,takes forever to load the loading screen looked awesome though
2,everything was lowkey lagging it was crashing a few times after the fontaine update but the thing that pissed me was after a long hurtful update with my own internet and not using internet connection they decided to restart my whole progress of downloading guessi am not playing anymore
2,game is not loading past the intro screen keeps shutting off please fix soon
2,im dropping the game from five stars to three stars because of the artifact grinding it is takes too much time to grind artifacts that only end up being absolutely terrible ones that are good have terrible rolls and end up becoming bad the resin cap should be increased as it is not enough for the amount of farmable content available for newer players it is harder for them to level up characters as they do not have those locations opened up
2,honestly i like the game but taiwanese player ruined the game they really have no manner i was klee main but they always think klee was junk and think i was dumb player everytime i do something they will spot on me like doctor observation mental patient what the f beside that lot of taiwanese hate this game i play genshin and they try to cyberbully me on facebook
2,the game is cool and fun and i can see lot of hardwork in developing this game but when it comes to gatcha pity system it is so bad i have been playing this game for nearly two years and to be honest i never got a soft pity and my winning ratio is lower than losing i lost nearly seven times and i won three times only i feel that gatcha system has to be removed and set it as guaranteed even if it is pulls so players can save for their favorite player and all
2,the game is constantly updating which is amazing cool new features and everything but how much bigger is it gonna get i can barely fit it in now we should be able to do something about the updates and gigantic file size
2,quitted a year ago and i gotta rate this one last time graphics are great so as mechanics even though you only have two skills the game does not have any end game content besides the abyss which is literally hell for average players it also feels like a job with below average rewards which hoyoverse intended to make us feel drained overall i will still recommend this to people who do not have time on their hands willing to grind endless hours and to those casual players with a lot of money
2,whenever launching this game it needs to download resources which always takes forever
2,the new update keeps crashing every time i try to play the game on my device
2,it took forever to load and then i uninstalled because i did not think it would ever load
2,i was able to play this only briefly after having deleted nearly every app that could be removed from my samsung a to make room for it then waiting for three hours while it downloaded via internet connection the next day it told me i needed to free up more space and started another marathon download bollocks to that game uninstalled
2,good game but bad event and worst greedy company who tried silent the community and no actual end game fiture three years and still no endgame content
2,after three years the issue about vertical camera movement too freaking slow is still not fixed and the devs does not seem to care it is like they do not want players to look up why the f they make climbing and flying monsters in the first place is this game only made for pc i used to play on ps before and it was awful it takes five freaking seconds just to look up it is also slow on mobile but at least you can swipe up x super fast just to look up and you cannot do that on a controller
2,i am starting to lose my interest in playing because i always spending a lot of time gathering primo gem then i get no hero i feel like i am wasting my time
2,the continously large updates make playing this game such a hassle about every month the size of the updates get larger and larger gigabyte then gigabyte and now gigabyte i have to draw the line somewhere and i cannot stand it anymore
2,i see people who play on pc reviewing this game giving it high ratings which yes while valid that the game as a whole is good this is a review for the mobile edition and should be rated as such with that being said do not bother with genshin on mobile the game has a compelling story cool mechanics and constant events however due to its constant expansion your phone will eventually be unable to handle it regardless of having next gen devices this is not optimized for phones
2,it is a good game i started when it was two four and it was great it was not that much bugging back then but now i installed it back and it is always bugging even wheni am at the lowest setting and my internet connection is great i never had any problem with my internet connection i do not play anymore but still that could be fixed
2,the game is good but they do not let you get good five star characters i tried for tartaglia previously and now too but i got some dumb five star character instead of tartaglia this is not good they should let us get good characters too
2,kept glitching really bad it would not let me walk i would automatically go to the water and fall into the abyss
2,came back after three four months there are some new quality of life improvements sure but yet never adding simple skip function especially since its also an mobile game as well when we play on phones we do not have that much time even with normal skip spamming it takes more than hr to finish heavy dialogue based quest and it has lot of those somehow its better if i stay away from game
2,hello hoyoverse i am having major issues downloading the game and insufficient storage space i have transfered the storage onto my sd card which has around gigabyte yet when i go onto the game it still says insufficient storage i only have two apps gigabyte free on my phone not sd card and no photos or files no matter how much i remove it just will not work i have tried multiple devices as well laptops included my laptop works two do not yet the game still crashes every five minutes on my laptop
2,please add a feature to make the camera drone view is fix and not moving because it makes me dizy while playing
2,this is why my genshin impact has a black screen and then there is sound but no picture is this a bug or what please fix it if it is a bug because this is the only game i have
2,hard crashed after the fontaine update its become unstable and will not even boot without freeze ups or crashes
2,good game but leveling up characters got so hard to the point where grinding up resources just to do stupid character ascension is hard and is wasting my valuable time when taking breaks
2,i cannot get in my ps account even i already link it with my gmail it is keeping said account or password error but after i tried to register it said account email already exist and after i change my password it is still the same
2,loved the game storyline is great and the graphics are amazing as well recently however after the fontaine update it keeps kicking me out of the game for no reason i have enough space and good connection with internet but it does not work
2,this game is good the graphics and gameplay are interesting however you will get bored after some time as the game does not reward your efforts for example after reaching level it provides no additional rewards making it feel like we are not getting recognized for our efforts this game tends to give what it wants rather than what its players want and it does not seem to care and listen to its global community especially
2,it would be nice if i could actually play it i got rid of most of my games to get this and it still says there is not enough storage the amount this takes is ridiculous and saddens me i cannot even get it back and play it
2,i do not have enough tine to use the resine you should learn from honkai star rail and give the oportunity to have more resine and also to save resine that was not used due to lack of time to be active in the game
2,why does it take a million years to load shaders and verify resources pc has the same issue loading and download speed are terrible no matter what platform you use
2,annoying game with loads of loading screen i really want to play this game but waiting for loading compiling resources etc make me do not wanna play it anymore
2,the game smooth and great i love playing it but the main problem is the nonsense dialogues it just to many i feel like i cannot handle this anymore i need to play not hear paimom voice ton i hate iiit we need a skip buttoon
2,everything was great until i started playing on mobile i was playing on playstation i do not how to bring back all my characters back and when i contacted genshin cs no one replied back i really had hopes in you genshin but turns out i was wrong
2,love the game but recently after the update i could not log back into my account i know my email and password but it keeps saying there is some sort of error can you either explain this or fix it
2,i was having a good time playing this but i do not know why i cannot suddenly play in asian server even thoughi am from asia it always says network error even though my internet is good i tried different servers and i can only play on europe server i do not know what to do i miss my account
2,everything is good but when comes to pulling you should be pp to pull as you can continuously loses and that makes the game boring and makes many people to quit it even everything is good
2,it keeps saying it will not let me load in in order to play its making me delete a bunch of space and even when i did it still said it would not work this game is good but it still says the same stuff i am not deleting anymore data
2,the game is amazing but the amount of space it takes it is too much like gigabyte at this point i am not even able to update anymore
2,i have not tried playing this game yet and i just downloaded it and registered an account and now i need to download like gigabytes gigabites worth of resources you need like to delete everything on your phone just to play this game it is like unplayable and i have like gigabyte left of storage space so why will not it let me download it
2,the game is good its just that i do not have a choice to update it and when i do not have enough space i have to delete everything just so i can free up gigabyte like that is a lot
2,game is totally fun but i have real issue in wishing system plus i do like aloy the most she is my main character since the beginning but she has been left away she has no cons its so annoying
2,well i saw this game on youtube and i would like to check it out but when i installed it i finished making my account then to the downloading recorded it says not enough storage space when i literally have gigabyte of storage left please i just want to play the game
2,i do not know what happened but after the update my genshin impact just will not run launch for reference my phone is infinix zero giga also before the update i have not experienced this issue soi am thinking that the update may have been the cause
2,i really do like the game but there is a big problem all the update cannot keep up with my memory space it got to a point that i have to delete it worse decision i regret it because i really do miss the game and anytime i have to reinstall it it say i do not have enough space to do the update nowi am upset and will not be able to do the fountain update wich i was really looking forward to please fix it i beg you ps i tried in my computer it still the same problem help please
2,it is nice game but too much conversations between the characters and there is no skip option to skip these conversations
2,i like the game but you are not increasing resin i am expecting to do the same thing that your own new game has done like increasing trailblazer power or resin something please increase resin so that we do not have to wait for so long
2,fix auto aim la rather closest to strongest enemy bro i missed so many reaction eh yes it is skill issue but at least have option like that for preference la
2,i like the game its just so hard spiral abyss two chamber one is so hard and it is even harder to get characters
2,i do not understand i just downloaded the game it installed and when it downloads again after tap the text tap to start it says i have insufficient storage space how
2,i had enough space to download the main thing but it would not let me download the important stuff including something i am fine you cannot fix your honkai star rail game ads are getting out of hand for me just because i cannot download the game it is not because of my storage it is because if my type of phone i cannot download it
2,i was downloading this game for my brother tablet and it kept on saying storage and i try everything and it did not work at alli am kind of disappointed i try using different account but it will not let me so yeah
2,it is okay but i had to delete apps and files because it keeps saying my storage is full and hopefully you can fix it and maybe in the future the game can have customization
2,so i hav been playing genshin for some hundred days and recently even though i have all the resources downloaded it is asking me to download another one gigabyte of data even though o have all the resources and among my frndsi am the only one who has been get this please resolve this problem
2,the developer is not listening to feedback like many other players i reviewed dehya and even submitted suggestions that was months ago and there has been no improvement dehya still performs like an average four star character instead of five star
2,this is a good game i enjoy playing it but as hoyoverse updates it i feel like my phone will explode it takes too much space there are some more confusions that make me question if i should continue playing and support the company but in general it okay
2,this game is awesome nice cutscenes cool characters and more but the problem is the stamina runs out to fast and when your stamina gets depleted in the water you lose some of your life but still it is still a really awsome game edit this game takes up too much gigabyte
2,as a mobile user along with ps there is quite a bit of lag generally even on ps it is not completely smooth mobile at that point is basically unplayable for me the wish system is also very dificult to work with as someone with terrible luck most events hardly even give you enough to do a ten pull most even giving less then five when is needed to guare notee a five star very pay play a ton to win
2,the update is boring and five star rates are a little to less so i do not kinda enjoy collecting alot of primo just to waste in second and getting one four star weapon
2,been playing this game since launch loved everything about it save for the low gacha drop rates and dismal rewards for things the game demands immense amounts of time for you to complete events which is a huge pain because it means that busier players end up missing out on the event rewards however meager they may be to begin with its a stunning game and a work of art but the barely concealed greed really is a huge turn off
2,really a fantastic game ruined by one aspect if you fall behind catching up is impossible limited time events require you to be at certain points in the story new characters are level capped unless you have access to new areas for their materials i think about returning and then remember that i have hours of storyline and side questing to catch back up new players would need a month or two of grinding just to take part in the current time limited never to return event broken
2,the game is fine what is not fine is that it takes up gigabyte on my device and does not offer controller support yet ios has it a game like this takes a lot of gametime to get the most out of it and i cannot fathom playing or spending money on a game that lacks something so basic for dozens of hours if controller support is added i will reinstall
2,it is a really good game but the company does not you guys do not care about mobile players and you keep releasing more heavy updates andyou are losing a lot of mobile players because of it the artifact drop system sucks it can take months to not be able to build a character and there are ppl who simply quit the game because they are too weak for the mobs in the game i hope you rethink your choices hoyoverse
2,beautifull environment and characters these two are the only redeeming factors for this game the absolute garbage of game design of the latest worm bosses which is recycled bugged kit of the newest character dehya and lack of endgame content show that something is missing or needs to change in the way the company designs the game
2,the gameplay options ongoing content and story have no equal on mobile but after three years of no android controller support while ios got it after year one this game is easier to play on a pc bow users and the ppl with mobile abilities are very difficult to use without a controller effectively i only have it downloaded because to make a purchase in game i have to use the first device i played it on to make purchases which is also annoying five star game but not on android
2,full of potential but ultimately just another money hungry company that does not listen to the player base reaching a point of releasing unfinished and unplayable characters with the premise of being eventually usable with future character releases for team composition no end game as well really slow paced main story development
2,i love the game for all of the amazing scenery definatly worth it but on my chromebook it continusly lags and it is very slow after about a month of playing just after three two update it started to crash so i decided to reinstall it but then it continually got stuck and crashed on the loading data page i have practically tried everything checking my computer is compatible with the game and it was i have reinstalled it again but to no avail such a good game but very sad i cannot play it
2,graphics and combat are great and so is the story however end game content is extremely lacking also the artifact system has been created in an unfair and predatory manner the developers have added so many layers of rng intentionally skewed towards bad stats like hp and def with the goal of forcing players to spend real money to get more reroll chances for the same reason they also refuse to relase artifact loadouts despite countless requests from the community
2,i have played this one for almost two years and my big problem is how can you rate this mobile friendly video game if each version includes extremely large areas which need a lot of space not all cell phones have infinite storage this game is practically exclusive for pc this game needs optimization in its graphics because the amount of storage required to play is simply absurdly gigantic and last but not least it is required to include a skip button
2,when i downloaded the app and started playing it everything was going well the graphics were good no lagging but when i opened the app the next day the game would completely freeze after ten seconds of playing it i cleared the apps cache restarted my phone checked for viruses it is impossible for me to lower the graphics since it freezes when i try to please tell me what the problem is and if it is a bug please fix it
2,in their most recent event instead of creating yokai they put masks on child models and called it good enough the story for me is excellent but they always cut corners and give very little back to the fans of the game they have said there will be no end game content so buying new characters is a waste log in once evey couple months to get new story and you will not miss a thing
2,great game after playing experience on android the game itself is absolutely amazing but the fact that this game has been out for so long and yet android is the only system that does not have controller support is criminal i would like to explore and play this game more often but i cannot play the game effectively on a touch screen controller support should have been added by now
2,it takes up way too much storage and it is super laggy even wheni am connected to internet connection or when my storage is enough it is laggy to a high hell i really enjoyed this game and i have some amazingly built characters but i just cannot deal with the lag it is so frustrating wheni am doing a quest and the characters move so slowly and with all the quests there are i can barley finish one just with the amount of lag this does not happen when i play other games they run smoothly effortlessly
2,after installing and login to my account via my mobile phone xiaomi redmi constellationit runs fine up until minute gameplay once you hit that time limit it starts to freeze up and for a while longer it goes back to normal but for a short period of time before it goes back again to freeze and lag i got frustrated on waiting and decided to uninstall the game from my phone sad it freeze up even though the game at first runs normally note phone did not heat up during the freeze lag
2,great game cannot complain about much i have a few problems though that bring it down a lot no endgame content for veteran players i have not even played for one year andi am almost out of content to fo outside of limited time content that is time gated two controls are difficult on mobile especially using bow characters three i cannot minimize the game to open another app for even a second or it will likely crash please optimize the game so i can minimize the game for a minute to open another app
2,tons of potential but held back by unreasonable time gating that feels like the game barely even wants you to play it is been an issue since launch and only becomes more of an issue as the game gets larger but hoyoverse never makes meaningful improvements to it resin requirement time gating needs to be removed from artifact farming entirely would solve almost all of the games problems and would encourage people to spend more money more often
2,will not even let me login without giving me the insufficient storage space pop up i have gigabyte left on my device so this is absolutely ridiculous game graphics are good but keeps crashing and downloading unnecessary things into my phone to the point that i have to delete everything that is in my device apps pictures etc edit contacted customer support were no help and never sent out an email to help me disappointed
2,starting to take up too much space on phone with each update mhy needs to do better with developing the mobile platform separately from pc and ps platforms pc is held back due to mobile incapabilities yet mobile is just getting bulkier to the point i cannot update i literally would not mind the cut backs on mobile as pc is the better experience anyway when i play i just want to quickly access from phone for quick tasks
2,it was fun whenyou are starting playing it but as you progress it will get hard at a certain point if you have a lot of patience in building upgrading a certain character you want this game is good for you edit due to the new update the game became laggy keep crashing and it is been hard to control the keys to mobile usersi am not satisfied in terms of the new setting update
2,horribly optimized for phone barely optimized for computer prices are absolutely ridiculous not the worst i have ever seen but will not even get you a ten pull unless you have the never been purchased before bonus the story and characters are fantastic honestly its the only thing that keeps me coming back every now and then but if you have a hard time controlling yourself when it comes to cough gambling please save yourself and do not get invested in this game
2,overall this game is fun but after a year of playing and being adventure rank it feels like there is not much to the game anymore other than events and archon quests it is just commissions and grinding domains for trash artifacts of course if you want to invest your time in this game and enjoy it all the power to you it just feels repetitive and not to mention how laggy it is on mobile teleporting enemy load in in domains and spiral abyss take seconds now my experience turned from to
2,beautiful game with several big cons while not impossible for free to play players it takes a lot of time to save up primo for guaranteed character also there are only five body types and close to no diversity in skin color the biggest problem are the artifacts the rng is horrible and it can take years literally i mean years to get a good artifact set resin is not the problem it is the drop rates and rng
2,i need more content that is not repetitive after completing all the story quests and important missions i guess the most cruel thing is to wait it is absolutely grueling and tedious to wait and just be unsatisfied with the next update it definitely is just a big cycle of completing waiting unsatisfaction and repeat do not get me wrong here it surely is a brilliant game with great graphics and an outstanding open world game to explore but it is just getting repetitive
2,so i really like the game for the most part however during the battle with the electro cube thing it would just reset and i could not beat it my friends have also had this trouble the rest of the game is just fine that bug just really upset me since i need the drops from it to upgrade my characters i understand that this is a really big game so i have no trouble waiting for fixes
2,i love the game it is really fun to play there is so much story a lot of things to explore and find but it gets a bit boring later the gacha system takes ages and you barely get enough primo from activities saving primo takes ages and there is the lack of diversity while the character designs are enjoyable and unique there is no diversity in body types and skin color please do improve that that and the slow paced farming for materials are points of critique for an otherwise enjoyable game
2,the game is so much fun the quality is great the gameplay is amazing but there are some things i do not like about the game one the game takes so much space i had to change from a pc player to a mobile player two the rewards in the game are not enough to do a one pull you have to use primo most of the quests get you primo three when you get above adventure rank it becomes so hard to get primo the only ways to get some are by doing dailys or spiral abyss the only other way is spending money
2,i have not played the game but based of the fandom i really like it i need help with something though when ever it says start i press start and then a loading screen pops up saying wear head phones for a better expirience i redownloaded it multiple times and i even switched servers maybe its because the first time i downloaded it i deleted it cause i thought it took too long to load hoyoverse please help me
2,it is a great game but the upcoming sumeru characters look like vanilla pudding and considering they are supposed to be from south asia the middle east and north africa that is a problem for me not only that but there are some other issues a lack of end game content an artifact system that has way too much rng some lazy writing with long dialogue options that are unskippable and an underdeveloped cooperative system i have loved this game and it is a comfort for me but there is issues
2,this is a game with which i have mixed feelings how to make a technically flawless game with great visuals great music good gameplay though with a for my taste forgettable story a lack of originality botw and its idiosyncrasies and a huge and sometimes boring open world and above all with dopaminergic overstimulation carefully designed to induce addiction and not necessarily fun in short a frankenstein with an identity crisis cute but ordinary
2,the game play is accurate but the pictures and ads portray the gameplay itself as very clear the game is very blurry for mobile and at the best settings very pixelatedi am told this was not always the case how do i fix the graphics to match the advertisements shown i have a pretty high end phone as well snap dragon with gigabyte ram i do not know what else it could be if the graphics were fixed this would be an easy four stars maybe five
2,good graphics on it but it is a copy of zelda the enemies are similar as well there is no real different biome and it looks the same the reasoni am not saying stuff about them copying the glider is because it is a good way to travel and without it everyone will complain about the travel being slow the puzles are not even puzles as they show you the way and paimon is super annoying and they show cut scenes like at the start swim over the lake for no reason just a zelda copy
2,this version of the game both looks runs and feels worse than the pc version this version does not even correctly recognize the refresh rate of my display and chugs on my device despite it having gigabyte of ram and a snapdragon triple which leaves the app a ton of overhead that it is not even using which makes absolutely no sense
2,the game is ten out of ten on pc however the mobile version should use some work it is extremely laggy even with everything at it is lowest settings my best guess is the character models have too many polygons for a mobile device to render yeti am not a programmer i would suggest to play this on your computer if you have one cause it runs much better on there
2,have been playing since the beginning literally nothing to do here anymore five minutes daily quests and ten minutes events twice in a month no worthy heroes to level up nothing to farm at this point thought the anniversary event might help but it turned out to be quite unsatisfactory as well it is probably nice to play in the beginning but the late game is boring and unrewarding af edit since then they have made some quality of life changes and that is the only reason i add a star
2,amazing game it is easy to play and has fantastic graphics the only issue is it takes it a very long time to load cutscenes i think this is because it is built closer to a console or pc game but it still is fun however you cannot really call the limited character banners banners because the pity guaranteed five star summon does not guarantee the rate ip character you are going for
2,i love this game to bits but there are so many things that could be fixed primo and five star characters should be way easier to get the pity system is also strange i feel like a five star could at least be every it is not too hard but it is still a bit of a challenge for free to play players that do not play for hours on end every day
2,pretty decent at first wonderful graphics and amazing character designs however as you level up it becomes increasingly difficult to gain any items for gacha summons and just to progress resin an in game item used to progress replenishes way too slow overall a fun experience but many fundamental flaws that ruin it
2,i came into this game really hoping to like it since everyone else seemed to like it but there is too many issues for me to really enjoy it first off is the awful quests you get sent on they range from ridiculously simple to almost impossible to complete without a guide secondly is the level scaling with the overworld mobs and monsters mobs get way too strong and dungeons become nigh impossible the story is interesting but it is locked behind your level and leveling up is a chore
2,endgame content is just abyss but the game gives you very little materials for powering up a character it is been a year yet artifact rng is still the worst the game is fun the first time you play it but once you reach the endgame there is nothing else to do you cannot even replay watch past archon story quests i will be uninstalling the game once my welkin ends i hope genshin will be better if i ever return
2,at first the game looked great but in time you start realizing all that is wrong with it is mechanics first of all there is the resin system it takes too long to regenerate and you need a lot of it to upgrade characters weapons and artifacts secondly there is artifacts the amount of luck that you need to get a decent set is incredible not talking about substats even just getting the right main stat may require weeks if you have bad luck unfortunately the letter limit stops me here
2,the artifact rate is trash the resin system is trash the only good about the game is the starting story the grafict and the character design three month of grinding at adventure rank and only one useable artifact the more you play the game the less fun it became at adventure rank plus for me it trash the fun was gone at the chinese new year the whole year playing the game only a few months is enjoyable
2,game is fun for the first few weeks great for playing instead of doing homework carried me through virtual class but around endgame game gets repetitive and boring the updates are not really fun and commissions are a chore the banners are all rerolls never anything completely new the weapons are all basically the same and the cooperative is poorly made free to play is okay but quite annoying after you get the limited banner character b constellationthe next one is a chance sad where the game is at
2,it started very well the base of the game is amazing characters exploration world design music but mihoyo does not care for their player base and is unwilling to change the player rewards specifically for long term veterans are really non existent this is separate from the anniversary reward backlash the games rewards as a whole are so greedy and even though i have invested a lot of money and time i get back nothing i am nearing quitting because there simply is not any endgame content
2,genshin has grown to be a beautiful game with potential to blow every other game out of the water i have been playing it everyday since start but lately i already see the patterns of a game falling off the radar one it just does not feel like the game does not reward the players for their loyalty two the promotions are coming from the players and the reward for all the hardwork put in is close to nothing three the gacha system is terrible in this game just awful there is more sadly
2,i play on ps but i decided to review here i used to really love this game and i still do but after you reach adventure rank there is nothing to do anymore this game feels more like a chore than an actual game which really sucks because when i first got my ps the first game i have ever downloaded was genshin impact the quests are draining artifact drop rates are horrible so it takes more than a month to finish building a character gacha rates suck resin system is a huge issue things need to change
2,it is been a year of playing this game and all i would say is that with recent updates unless you have high end mobile devices it is pretty hard to play the game as it tend to lag and crash cutscenes tend to go black screen and audio goes bonkers in terms of events i feel like it has been going downslope as time goes on there is no end game gradual progression is time gated and rng and event rewards feel so lackluster it does not feel like a reward at all
2,really bad rates for items this game has a gambling system that preys on children and adults alike the gameplay is nice but the system of getting characters or new weapons are very poor the developers would require you to spend more than necessary compared to other gacha games the number of repetitive three star weapons is also very high with a limited number of options there is a higher chance of getting pieces of each three star weapons than completing a set of four star weapons one each bad
2,game is beautiful it has many unique things but once you reach a higher adventure rank there is no content anymore it gets boring all you do is farm some domains and you cannot do much of that either because of the resin cap and that is it you log out there is no more fun left no content just nothing resin cap too high and content too low artifact farming takes months before you get even a single decent piece there are so many things that could should be changed unofortunately
2,when i first started this game it was amazing lots to do big open world story quests but as time went on many of the issues became appare not electro reactions suck artifact rng is horrible no end game content bad resin system characters weak on release character bugs never being fixed or addressed and a bunch of other qol issues after community submitting feedback for over a year nothing has changed and there has been no communication or acknowledgement of the glaring issues
2,this has to be one of the best games i played the graphics the music it is all awesome but there is no end game content well we could farm artifacts and bosses but the resin system eight minute for a single resin is a bit too much decreasing the time to restore resin would be a nice most games would give awesome rewards on anniversary especially the first one then mihoyo decided to make the rewards gacha too good game bad company
2,i really did like this game on launch i played for a month straight forward a year later and everything became boring the events are unoriginal and a chore to do the story quests are inconsistent in pacing and content there was even one with a million plot holes and the combat is lackluster apart from character skills there is nothing enjoyable about the combat once you get used to the characters you have everything gets old really quickly
2,two words anniversary rewards edit anniversary rewards got better but still boring as f because everything just feels like a chore i loved this game so immensely just three weeks back but nowi am just not enjoying it as much events are almost the same thing combat as button mashy as ever props to the graphics and music though inazuma was rushed in my opinion the enemy army and the rebels army was just or less guys going at it with each other it was more of a brawl than a war
2,game is free and some of the content is good i do not like the resin system and most of the artifacts that i get from the dungens is garbage i feel like the drop rate is rigged for example if i try to farm the set i want alone in my world i do not get the set i want but if i farm it in my friends world i get it easily we me and my friend try to farm our sets by visiting one another its so frustrating and gems are so over priced i have spend money on this game but now i wish did not
2,the gameplay is fun but improving your team in this game is extremely slow you need to kill the same boss a lot of times farm a large amount of gold exp and skill books so you need more than a month worth of energy to reach max level and level the skills to level nine level ten requires a very limited item for a single character do not forget about the equipment the rng for getting artifacts is insane you could be farming for months to get a set of just decent artifacts also spending energy
2,the content drought is real rewards are also highly scarce when you go up the world level it becomes frustrating unless you pay for it it will be very boring in the endgame and that is putting it lightly too much flaws that needs to be addressed such as the rng artifacts system and resin and that is barely scratching the surface
2,the game was all fine and dandy in the beginning but they started getting greedy and lazy as the game went on the rewards for the anniversary are the obvious but other than that there are more issues than i can type with the word limit kokomi being an absolutely useless unit yoimiya having a broken kit the rushed story quests and the list goes on some are not even that hard to fix you can do better mihoyo
2,amazing artistic choices are clearly visible in the environment and the game has great storytelling and appealing multidimensional characters though problems still arise the gacha system is very greedy the resin system inhibits endgame progression and the lack of account security is concerning to say the least edit mihoyo have clearly demonstrated that they do not listen to the player base whatsoever nor do they care about the current state of the game hopefully they can hastily resolve this predicament and reengage with the community because i can no longer recommend this game to anyone
2,i have played this game since october of without any amount of spending into account genshin impact itself at it is core is not a horrible game the graphics are good the controls are smooth the combos on each character and elemental combos are nice the story is interesting but extremely slow so far with the game being out a year now and only one new area out of three problems being resin being too restrictive for free to play players making farming generally horrible across the board
2,i had pre registered for genshin when it came out and loved it but when you get to some of the mid adventure ranks the grind gets tedious the drops do not increase get better very much and when they do event rewards they do not give you as much as they did when the game was fresh which is rather annoying because that means they want you to spend money on their gatcha stuff which makes it harder to be free to play and still be good
2,how about google stops taking down my reviews first of all the state of the game has been disastrous for the past two patches new characters released with bugged or underperforming kits existing characters having bugs for months and no balance patches for a specific character since patch one two the latest main story quest has been extremely rushed leaving out too many detials and raising questions but in a bad way the quality of the game certainly dropped recently
2,a beautiful world and a good experience with fun gameplay at first but later in the game almost nothing i do feels truly rewarding the rewards are always so underwhelming and building new characters is no longer as fun for me because of how difficult it is as a result of the games strange character leveling system and the tedium that comes with collecting the limited resources i would give a much higher rating if it was not for it is major flaws that become appare not in the endgame
2,this game is seriously amazing cross platform allows me to log onto my pc and continue playing when i want as long as you do not mind the gacha element it is a terrific free l open world zelda botw style adventure with a great story edit after a year of playing and grinding i find new five characters way too costly in terms of play time and the rewards are so excruciatingly minimal cannot recommend this game anymore
2,for about a year now the game is now getting boring imagine having more characters even though the game is still in its third nation inazuma standard characters are now useless it looks like this now a pay to win game for you to enjoy hopefully some of the featured characters can also be obtained through standard banners in the future like the four stars
2,this game is amazing it really is the amount of effort put in it is a beautiful landscape a world to escape to the storyline is amazing and had me hooked from the beginning and the characters and their designs are so fun to build and work with however it is been a year and there are inevitably problems that need to be solved at higher ars rewards get progressively worse the anniversary is also not helping encourage players nor solve these problems
2,i have been playing since launch and i have seen some major improvements on in game content throughout the updates however communication between the company and players has been steadily declining to the point where sincere feedback is not taken into account anymore it definitely influences the experience especially with a game in which people invest a lot of time and for many players money as well
2,the game starts out very good but it can become repetitive after a while the recent land added was underwhelming and felt rushed and the anniversary is the most lack luster i have ever seen in a game it is hard to believe it is a celebration when the company did not hing for it seems like they are content to put in the bare minimum to keep players engaged after the opening areas
2,played this game since last december and it was really good i did not mind the scarce resources too much since i played in moderation but at times i felt significantly limited by the resin system and artifact grind i ended up buying the monthly subscriptions to show my support for the game but the direction and attitude the company has taken towards their player base is patronising and unthankful to say the least apart from that i love the music and will listen to it on spotify from now on
2,the game has been nothing short but wonderful from the start however with the sheer amount of bugs that annoys the hell out of players naming the horrifying auto aim for bow user as an example has not been even mentioned in any bug fixes till today is a sign of how they cherry pick feedbacks from players the latest two one patch has a very obvious rush vibe to it be it in the story quest to the character development needless to say happy birthday mhy
2,the quality of the game content follows a linear curve along progression easy fun well done in the beginning by the time you get to end game it feels like playing a thinly veiled money making scheme the first nation was great the second was good the third released in two has been wholely lackluster exploration was fun for a while combat is designed poorly progress and the game throws more enemies at you use a shield or get hit into five other enemies hitting you into five more
2,beautiful game great story so far and runs smoothly on my phone samsung galaxy would love to see controller support for mobile added as it would be more comfortable to play that way edit over the past year there has been a large drop in communication with players bug fixes and rewards content is heavily gated behind resin energy making the level of farming needed difficult there is a great game here aside from these issues but it needs some serious work at this point
2,i started game when they were officially released in american and enjoyed a fair bit for a while then i lost interest and kind of stopped playing the game after almost a year i came back to play because my friend said there are a lot more things to do which was true then i was anticipating an anniversary event to boost me up a bit and slowly started to see a lot of people talking about event being really mediocre and turns out it was not only i was baffled by amount of free wish they give out amount of effort they put into anniversary event was just mind boggling in a worst way possible i think it would have been better if they just did not give out anything for free for the anniversary event and just put deep discounts on some of the stuff they offer would have been much better i cannot give anything lower than two star because i did actually enjoy the game and missing out on anniversary freebee will not probably make myself stop playing but this lack of communication ought to get some negative opinions and i think they are all valid
2,the game is beautiful and the combat system and characters are fun the story started good but the recent inazuma arc was rushed and messy the developer has also slowly stopped communicating with the player base they have ignored common simple qol changes looking at you expidition user interface and common feedback on characters kits this does not feel like the game i started playing a year ago i hope things change for the better
2,needs controller support asap basic things are easy to do but once you get into rapid character changing combos and tighter movement it becomes a hassle also i have large hands that cover the screen and imporant information gets covered like the bottom character in the party roster on the right side i play on a note ultra and cannot fathom how others play it on small screens
2,i do not really do review bombing i hate the idea of it but ifi am being honest the rating is not just for the rewards i have come back into the game and i can in all honesty say it is gotten dull the grind and daily content is short and unfullfilling the gacha system continues to be trash with the two hard pity necessary for banner maps being kind of barren and the exploration basically boiling down to go to the interactive map alt tab to genshin and go where the map tells you to they did fix the gameplay from a year ago to being more interractive and responsive but from materials grind to level up boost grind it is too tiring to actually get into if you plan on bothering just play through the story mode and do not get invested wait for a couple of months maybe play only the event stuff and when a new region comes out just play the story mode on that too
2,to be honest the mobule version should be less demanding on space its practically impossible to download and play this game on most phones unless you have a high capacity phone or sim card you will never get to even see or play the game at all i do not like having to delete everything just to see a insufficient storage message
2,soo play it on pc meh combat is enjoyable play it on mobile yeah i better find another game to invest my time with controls is not that flexible for a game company that already has history in mobile gaming the cpu usage is high due to its being open world game gameplay is boring after a while too many thing to gather for weapons that can be change after an update enemy is not quiet hard mostly rehash recycled ones graphics on performance mode is good
2,really cool just too much for probably a lot of phones to handle my phone is good quality but it still struggles with the game i cannot even play anymore due to all the updates and having it not be able to load and all the lagging i would suggest making an option where you can make the graphics be less advanced for those with lower quality phones
2,this game is unforgiving for people who lag a lot especially during a timed challenge when it lags during a timed challenge one i cannot deal any damage two the enemies will not spawn until seconds after and three the timer still moves while the game is frozen wished they removed timed challenges for story quest and ascension quest since low end users cannot complete it due to the timer
2,i love everything about this game but it is just not optimized for phone after minutes of playing my phone will start overheating and it will become a lagging nightmare the cutscenes are especially bad you cannot even watch them because of the lag and stuttering my phone is pretty strong with six gigabytes of rami am also playing on the lowest graphics and it says my game is supposed to run smoothly i have nothing running in the background
2,i love this game to be honest one of my favourites i play it on my mobile and found over time a few glitches for example i did the update and now it will not let me login because it says there is an update and to do it before i can log in again to receive primo i click confirm and then nothing happens and there is no update i bought the blessings of the welkin moon and three or four times my primo never went in sometimes it glitches and i get stuck on a hill flying or failing sad
2,the game is fun and i liked playing it with the time i have but there is one thing that is really annoying in mobile phone overall controls first the automatic view adjustment while in battles and when gliding as well it really getting on my nerves that this view adjustment must be turn off in the options because it zooms in automatically and the overall rewards that you get in progressing the game is very awful how little rewards you will get when you progress
2,i like the game but i do not know why it keeps crashing i have gigabyte ram snapdragon with gigabyte rom vivo but it keeps crashingi am waiting for the switch version so i can actually play this or just please fix it for some phones many people who uses vivo are experiencing the same too thank you keep up the good work and also please release it on switch there are so many switch player are waiting for it to release
2,the game is fun and all but i encounter a lot of bugs just after seven minutes i played the most annoying bugs i met are the keayas freezing walk on water bug when i press the button exactly show in the tutorial either the water did not freeze or it froze but no ice was shown second bug is during the stormterror dragon the dragon in the cutscene is fine but during gameplay it bug out my entire screen was cover in blue and grey of the dragon wings causing me to fight it blind oh it kick me out of the game sometimes
2,it is a really good game and all but the amount of storage it takes up it is a huge amount of storage and my phone always hangs after playing even while playing the game is really laggy and does not give that pleasure of playing anymore it usually happens during cutscenes the video completely stops it is not really that cool afterwards
2,as the rate said two five since one i played this game and all that months in game there is only one problem i had intense frame drops there is a problem in one four i heard of crashing but it would be fixed sooner but you should give an attention of optimizing the game for mobile the old settings were more better than the previous graphic settings please hear me out its a good game but still problems might result of people quitting the game shortly
2,the control for android interface is terrible it is hard to aim i prefer using pc for this and trying to collect drops and items are devastating due to the few seconds of loading before the option to collect appears game crashes a few times after the current update too please add controller option at least other than that the game is mostly fine
2,game is absolutley beautiful and the story is really good but i was deeply disapointed once i downloaded it to find its essentially a one player game though a cooperative with another person can be done it certainly is not an mmo rpg had this been done in a the same way that toram and other similar games have with these graphics and depth of story this would be unbeatable
2,used to the best among its genre for a couple of months after its initial release now its nothing but a hollow shell of its former self terrible progression system hardly any content left after adventure rank besides the merciless grind unless you dump poor rng system with a buggy mobile port graphically its really appealing to the eyes but that is about it i used to love this game but now even the veteran players have to admit that its an unfinished game best of luck in your future endeavours
2,good graphics but very stuttery on a high end phone controls are quite bad and the gameplay is constantly interrupted by cutscenes that cannot be skipped your assistant high pitched voice is going to get on your nerves very quickly story and the entire setup sounds rather childish would not recommended if you are above maybe nice if you manage to skip past the initial annoyance i just cannot
2,the game is amazing in almost every aspect but its not exactly built for mid tier and low end fones even at the lowest possible settings i am experiencing low frames i could put up with is at first but whenever some cutscenes come up the game goes buggy and janky i had to delete the game because i could not handle it please improve this game to make it friendlier to fones and please fix the visual bugs most of your players are actually experiencing
2,i enjoyed the game at first the graphics are gorgeous but i am not the type to focus on storyline type stuff and half of this game is story line you cannot even skip it the controls are okay but flying and fighting can be very challenging i stopped playing about level because i had a quest to do a task and i was supposed to kill a big monster and i could not do it i kept switching and reviving characters they were all leveled up to the max as we are their weapons very frustrating
2,the game itself is great on pc the android version however suffers greatly from the lack of controller support you can technically play this game with touch controls but it was clearly designed with other input methods first in mind i cannot give this over two stars without controller support especially now that there support for controllers on ios but not android for some reason
2,i can not keep playing this game every time i start to get aheadi am blocked by the arbitrary adventures level other times it is the controls that screw me over as the camera may decide to face a different direction or my character just runs off a cliff trying to improve characters is down to pure luck in the gatcha as the drop rates are horrible i really did enjoy myself once but as i have gotten further in i only find myself becoming frustrated and uninterested
2,honestly i was kinda dissapointed because i have heard of this game online i wanted to try it so i installed it after i created an account and tried to enter the game it says that you have to download something which is normal but there is a problem a huge problem i cannot get into the game at all it says that my storage space is too small or something like that i delete some apps and photos nothing happens i delete more still nothing happens
2,there was no problems that arise when i was playing my first month of genshin but after new updates the audio had some weird radio sounds that i could not remove and it was not my phones fault because only in the app i could hear it my ping is also good and the graphics was not lagging but the audio still makes the weird radio noises i hope this will be fixed
2,i love the game and everything about it but after one two i cannot play the game without litterally crashing four five per hour update it is getting worse yesterday i could not play with out crashing in less than ten minutes with a total of times in minutes of play then today as of this moment i have crashed three times with four mintues in the loading screen and one total minute in game i was just checking notifications all three times
2,game is pretty good gatcha is not bad but two major problems poor controls and settings to fix and or invert and anytime you minimize the app for anything it completely reboots it which takes forever to get back in accidentally answer a text reboot want to look something up complete reboot it is horrible phone call in the middle reboot
2,it is frustrating when i try to fight dvalin becausei am having graphic issues whenever dvalin appears in return i cannot clear the a long shot quest i cannot see my character and dvalin during this quest because of graphic issues i also have some issue while fighting with cryo ice element slimes everytime i fight against them my game will have a massive slowdown because of this i cannot complete the lost book quest i hope that the upcoming updates will fix this issues
2,the game is a pretty fun single player experience while you have quests to do once you hit the stamina wall resin then the game becomes a really poorly monetized mobile game getting new chatacters is very expensive due to the fact that the it costs around dollars to get a five star pity even after getting a new character it takes almost a months worth of resin in order to build them up to a usable level
2,this game is almost unplayable i do not know if this is specific to the pixel two but the game has a nasty habit of completely disconnecting the internet connection on my phone causing the game to have an error and have to reconnect it does it every time i have to fight any enemies the latency becomes and literally no damage will be done good looking game that i have been waiting for but right now this is unplayable with the network issues it has
2,the game is great but it is so hard to get better characters to make the gameplay easier i wish i would known that you cannot crossplay between two different regions i would not have downloaded this on my phone and pc it actually sucks that i cannot play with my friends and get their help on the european serveri am stuck on the american server because the ping is better but i do not want to grind on the european server just to play with my friends do not download if you think you can crossplay single player is fine
2,at first everything was five stars but then you get to the end and you get extremely gated collecting materials becomes a chore and you spend hours just running around the map endlessly for the time doing the same route actual materials such as coins and xp require you to wait for resin and the game play that is tied to spending resin takes no more than a few minutes it is fine if you want to enjoy the graphics but do not bother spending money on this
2,this game is good buti am rating it from the perspective of a completionist in that regard this game is flawed there is an ongoing bug with the anemoculus where they can get collected without registering meaning you are hardlocked from ever maxing out the statues two anemoculus an incredible frustration as i have spent the vast majority of my gameplay methodically collecting them marking the map in a grid system etc edit geoculus bug fixed itself with restarting anemo still bugged
2,at first it was a very fun game then once you progress later in game the resin system appear the resin system is so limiting that you basically stuck cannot upgrade weapon cannot upgrade character etc i will probably leave this game soon as the grind get really crazy after the initial stage almost impossible to stay as free to play user unless you just want to torture yourself genshin impact resin impact
2,its a great game with beautiful graphics a storyline with substance and a decent or mediocre cooperative option depending on how much you like playing with others but there is just one thing that ruins the whole experience whenyou are knee deep in genshin impact the resin system is absolutely atrocious and limits the progression to upgrade your characters by a mile it really differentiates a whaler between a free to play and in the middle are of course the goldfish dolphins if only the resin system was not so bad it would be an absolutely amazing game there is just a lot of things to be done but man the resin in just a knee capper just to clarify i am at adventure rank and have spent a bit of money on the game and not speaking out of my ass the resin system is just garbage
2,before i begin i wanted to like this game unfortunately there are so many small issues i had within the first minutes i could not continue first option settings not available right away and when i did unlock them they were very lackluster second please put a lock on feature third please let us adjust control placements the movement pad is almost awkwardly too far towards the center also picking up items requires pressing the button in the middle of the screen very annoying
2,this game is fantastic starting off but grinds to an absolute halt after playing for the first few days you barely can progress as more and more roadblocks start showing up resin system needing enough money xp books materials to upgrade characters and then eventually you will have to only be able to progress using keys unlocked by doing all your dailies for two days deceptive at best manipulative at worst gacha rates developers should really tweak all this because all the good press will sour
2,truly evidence that popularity does not suggest greatness the game is absolutely beautiful but nothing you do has any substance story is boring and unskippable there is little significance to exploration because you do not need most of the things in the field food is not necessary to progress in the game enhancing gear just feels like an annoying obstacle that you have to get through just so you can keep progressing and perhaps the most irritating thing is how clunky the transitions from activity such as swimming climbing etc are to going back to walking combat especially during timed challenges in fact it is almost like the climbing time challenges are showcasing how terrible the game is at guessing when the player wants to climb up and when the player does not want to climb up it is irritating during normal exploration as well since you will randomly climb up trees for no reason not to mention gacha rates are abysmali am still going to play this because i like gambling with free resources but to say that i like this game just because i plan to play it daily would be a complete utter lie
2,finished stormterrors lair i can safely say that early on the gameplay is an absolute blast however this game has a few fundamental flaws that ruin mid late game for me the game relies heavily on stun mechanics where the only way to defeat most enemies is to use continuous stunning attacks to prevent them from using their stunlocking combos resistance to attack interruption is an actual stat the world levels up as you do making grinding difficult sometimes controls stop working
2,great story great graphics great locations but fix the multi player kick function it is stupid that you can be kicked out by players after multi player events finish i lost time and treasure due to this ridiculous feature needless to say this makes me not want to touch multi player until this is fixed
2,fun until it is not the prologue chapters and casual exploring is an enjoyable time and the world is vibrant and interesting then you reach adventure rank enemies universally become harder and you realize your freebie units are not up to snuff resin is stamina but even more limited with an eight hour wait after two boss encounters in order to get upgrade materials you will need game could be better but good design and loop is held back by freemium mechanics
2,hello mihoyo i think you might recognize me from the email julliane jeon if you did not saw it please check it is about the graphics i cannot see them when i walk or rotate the point of view the graphics disappear maybe a bug or glitch my phone is oppo reno i personally think that the problem is the phone not the game ifyou are gonna read the email no need this ones just the same as the email so if you saw this thank you very much for reading
2,the story is pretty bad like a really bad anime the gameplay however makes for a pretty good rpg if you take the time to learn when to swap between characters and play to their strengths the only real difficulty comes from the iffy touch controls considering this game has controller support on other platforms it was a pretty dumb decision to not allow the same control option for mobile players also where the heck are the menu options i cannot find any sound or graphics settings
2,game is beautiful but i cannot understand why it keeps crashing on my samsung ultra this usually happens wheni am going through cut scenes or loading screens the audio starts getting distorted then the screen just freezes i have adjusted my in game settings to low buti am still encountering the problem hope someone could help me fix this
2,had a very long loading time especially when it displays the elemental symbols also when i enter the game my internet speed goes down to kb and says reconnecting to server every time but when i watch movies in youtube speed is fast the landscape change each time i rotate or move around what is happening is it my phone can i know the system specifications required to play this game i really want to play this game
2,the game is absolutely beautiful the soundtrack is amazing the graphics and gameplay are great unfortunately of people will not be able to play as their favorite characters unless they spend hundreds of dollars it is almost impossible to get the best characters and weapons draw rates are stupid low and prices are super high if you guys make this system more reasonable i will even spend some money on the game to support it but currently it is out of question
2,a wandering mess let start with the positives english voices are great the music is phenomenal and the graphics are stunning the negatives the camera is unforgiving the controls are directionless as ifyou are fighting in a compass and you have to maneuver your way back to facing north after swinging the sword around you lose your sense of direction there is no map just a sort of a radar that only shows symbols to where you must visit no thanks
2,i downloaded the game on pc and it was awesome i am trying it on my mobile right now reno three pro and it does not work very well the textures do not load in to the game so my character and a lot of models does not have faces and some models are not visible like a whole building disapears i will play it still on pc but on mobile its a hassle
2,dl the game took a long time even with hi speed internet connection i was constantly felt lost as it was hard to get my bearing right with the location map on left corner the navi is useful but the trail drops off often so i have to click the navi icon again and again running place to another is slow and far so if i can teleport straight away it will be so much neater the temple quest has a minute level requirement and i still do not know how to level up quickly other than eating envelopes tough game
2,alot of problens when i load the tutorial after defeating the slime my audio just cuts out i tried to restart the game but it keeps happening everytime i defeat the slime so i ignored it and moved on but when i touch the teleporter my game just freezes and just gets stuck there all the way please fix this i cannot progress or even enjoy the game like this
2,despite the obviously high production value genshin impact lacks some basic qol features i have seen out of other mobile games there is no setting to change the location of the virtual joystick no controller support and no options for changing the layout of the attack and skill buttons the camera also makes moving and combat a real chore always zooming in and pointing at the ground the player characters head keeps blocking thingsi am trying to see like enemies
3,very fun to play but after you finish everything you have nothing to do there is no feeling of progression in the game so it just feels the same as if i am first playing it but the levels are just higher but if that problem is fixed this is literally the game of the decade i love playing but leveling up characters is just tiring when the most of the domains are just the same thing it just gets repetitive after a while
3,the game is a lot of fun if it can be accessed i log into all kind of account like most people and this game takes problematic to a whole new level especially if you try using more than one device to play that is the reason for the star rating the best thing to do is pick one device and commit to it only if something happens to that particular device well unfortunately i guess one starts the game over again with another everything else about the game is great superb even
3,alright everything is fine i could now play after deleting the cut scene from previous quests the only problem is in the quest to get paint in the melousines village i would suddenly glitch and my phone would turn black after several minutes my phone would restart by itself when i teleport to somewhere else and walk around it was fine this have been happening for several weeks now and i do not think it is my phones storage
3,with no doubt genshin storyline lore and gameplay is amazing but lately the update have alot of graphics in the world i cannot see alot of walls and ground sometimes i walk on space this happened first at in the city and possion i cannot see things like the long wooden bridge i am a mobile player and my storage is not the problem i do not know if it is a me problem but it never happened in any other nation and it bothers me that i cannot see things graphics quality are a little bad
3,my gaming experience so far has been good although i have been having this bug ever since the start of the game it is the type of bug that has this shining effect that blinds my vision whenever i go across these places the ground the water surface and the sea floor i could not explore properly when this is around also i would like to add an issue regarding of a different kind of bug which is every time cutscenes in the archon and world quest play it freezes and forces me to restart entirely
3,great and not so much great music background art though the characters could use more detail lots to do a pro and con nice that game offers so much but if you actu have a life there is not enough time to do everything on there keep up w limited events main story side quests char quests level up home design etc serenitea pot is another issue the item placement limit is super low also their issue resolving sucks they ignored me completely and if your game gets hacked your screwed
3,the battle mechanics and storyline are good but i only found one issue it takes up too much storage the game itself is big and the updates can sometimes reach to gigabytes in my opinion i want to enjoy a game where i do not have to worry about my storage getting full and not being able to play the game due to full storage i am really looking forward to this games improvement
3,a very good game but made intentionally unfun in manipulative ways that force you to gamble and form daily habits both of which are basically emotional abuse again the game itself is a solid with some of the best exploration combat and characters in gaming especially for mobile but that is only when it is not locking your characters behind a grindwall that you can speed up with cash or constantly jingling lootbox characters in front of your face like car keys downright evil devs
3,beautiful game and amazing characters the only problem i have with it is the amount of storage space it takes up other than that it is a wonderful game i changed my rating to three stars because i had to delete literally all of my photos and videos just to play the game and words can not describe how furious i am because of it i cannot believe i wasted my time on this game luckily i did not have super important photos or videos but all of my time on other apps has been thrown out the window
3,it is a very good game interesting stories characters powers and the graphics are good it is like an anime game but the dialogues are little bit boring there are so many dialogues i usually not read them i just skip them cause i do not like reading some may like it but still i like this game and you guys try it will not disappoint you yeah i know it takes so much space your phone might exploded but do not worry it will not happen this game is good on pc ps ps or maybe iphone etc
3,migrated from pc to mobile for certain reasons i thought the same smoothness from pc would translate to mobile i am regretting the decision the controls are clunky and there is a noticeable input lag the user interface is not easily changeable and dodging is a whole lot harder i am genuinely considering uninstalling and just sticking to pc
3,for being one of the top grossing gotcha games you would think they would raise the rates on five star characters or lower the cost dollars for two ten pull for a chance on a five star is really stupid even if you have a pity limit personally i love the game although the rates exchange on currency for a very slim chance of landing a star is horrible great game but do not waste your money it is like playing the lottery only slightly better
3,after i updated my game for things were smooth i have entered into the game and have visited fontaine even started the archon quest and what not my game crashed when i was trying out the diving feature for the first time ever since then whenever i start up the game i am stuck in the elements loading screen and then it just shuts off from the start i have been playing this game in the very same device and had no issues in previous updates
3,i cannot even download the game it installed fine but the extra files will not download i have cleared my storage and even gone as far buying an extra storage card for my phone but it still will not download first impressions are that the graphics are lovely i am just unable to get past the first screen it is disheartening my phone is brand new as well i cannot see where the issue could be
3,the game looks really good and cool but i cannot even log in without being told there is an error and i have deleted it and downloaded it at least six separate times and i still got told the same answer before and i am not saying i do not like the game it looks really good but i think it is meant for pc and not mobile
3,i love genshin and there characters and story also exploration is fun but the resin cap is very annoying as a free to play it makes building a character ten times longer and harder and sice genshin is so big now it makes it even harder to keep up also the storage issues are getting really bad even if i delete past data but besides that genshin is a beautiful game
3,its a really good game however after about a year of playing as someone who never read any stories the content got quite repetetive and gradually i stopped playing not just that reason but the fact i am on mobile and can barely move around without lagging if you are new i would definitely recommend this game though some characters need acension materials from later game content making it hard to use better characters effectively if you are a new player but start game content is very fun
3,quests cannot be done in cooperative which really makes the experience lacking also there is no skip dialogue button npcs are unavailable to interact with in cooperative as well it could have been game for people who just want to grind together especially if the drops were either one to one or for both parties when farming together sad the multiplayer just feels like an afterthought
3,good stories and art game graphics is also good but everything could be better if this has controller or keyboard and mouse support please make it a big deal if this ever becomes an update so that i can come back and play again along with my friends playing this on a tablet is not very immersive
3,i do love this game by lore but new update made my phone litteraly crash and to clear that fact i do not play on some microwave its a pretty modern phone but the fact that the game itself is crashing is quite un settling and always makes me annoyed once i was in the middle of a story quest and then when i cutscene stopped the game has crashed also i need to say how laggy it is the game is not designed to be played on a phone at all so i guess i stick to playing on computer
3,it is a very nice game but when i was just about to play and i was in the loading screen my screen suddenly freezes and that goes on until my phone realizes that no one was using it even though i have tapped my screen countless times yet it did not work and when i finally open my phone back i am kicked out of the game its really sad because i have played on the account for months or more and i have tried re installing and logging but it still will not work
3,this is overall an amazing game to play during free time and is the best by far in exploring thrill and lore in my opinion though some of the quests do not give an explaination on what to do so this is the reason why i had to spend more time going back and fourth on youtube which is very time wasting i wish that you guys add more instructions to quests lines
3,i have been playing this game for over two years now overall i love genshins overworld character designs combat system and music but i cannot help feeling like the company does not care about giving players quality of life improvements sure they added the new comission sytem and will make weekly bosses more accesible later but still have not increased resin cap made artifact swapping easier or made any special permanent combat mode excluding spiral abyss my rating will go up if this is fixed
3,great graphics in game experience is marvelous but gaming rewards are horrible bad rates demanding too much time for trying to get enough resources besides the problems due to huge size of the game they said there would be a nintendo switch version and it is been three years and no sign of it i hope they considere their players more as they are always improving the gaming experience on other games they have created such as honkay
3,honestly i love genshin i have been playing it for almost a year now the reason why i give it a three star is because of storage problems i know they have add a setting to clear the done quest data but i recently reinstalled genshin and now i cannot access that feature because there is no sufficient space so a request please enable user to use that feature when reinstalled as when its reinstalled it loads all the data right from the first quest and now i am unable to play the game
3,pretty nice game but i think a lot of things should be done the amount of storage needed is kinda ridiculous like when we are not even at a quest yet why do we need to install them all together it just wastes storage compatibility with devices and we need a skip dialogue more resin more gameplay and endgame content usually we do not even know what to do when playing so focus on story more yeah overall nice game with beautiful characters and a lot of potential kinda wasted though ngl
3,i have been playing the game for a long while now and there is a lot to love about it especially the fact that the game engine almost completely mocks zelda breath of the wild but the combat does not involve as much as it should it is not very in depth i think there should be more melee combos with your sword the fighting is boring i like that i have to remember to use the right element that adds some depth to the fight but i cannot get into it when each character only has two melee combos
3,gameplay is ok story lines are long and epic and the world when you unlock it is huge with teleport to get places faster but some missions have half explanations and no locations to go back and find them i have things to find at the ruins which ruins so it is not all straight forward try and level up things but battles are gett ng harder so i cannot pass levels and get stuck in places in the game as i cannot continue forward giga on my phone are you serious giga
3,the game is still fabulous till this day but some of us players got a problem because even us using a high end device after the fontaine patch we have experience fps drop more often and the game feels so slow not like it used to before that is one of the reason i quit after the fontaine patch if it is possible please do fix it in the coming new patch optimize the game more that is all goodluck
3,it is a good game but as of fontaine i get a lot of lag and loading times for example right when you open the game it says checking for updates and just stays there until i clear cache data or restart the app it is kind of annoying because that did not happen before and i now have way more lag i had only gotten lag when i turned up the graphics i am on the lowest settings with fps and i lag a lot i cooperative and even in cutscenes please fix also the game is starting to take up too much space
3,the only down side or better to stay worst downside is that we do not have android controller support it is just frustrating i used to play on ps and pc with a controller playing on inch screen is still frustrating when can we get controller support
3,the game is good the artwork is great and the updates are always exciting the archon quests are extremely emotional which is great for me as i love these types of lore games the one thing that is upsetting me is that some details that are not really useful take more gigabyte to download and the game is not good for smaller phones anymore and you are gonna need advanced phones now also the amount of gigabyte it is using is unbelievable as it crashes my phone completely sometimes
3,the game is really enjoyable your definitely better off playing it on pc or playstation though as its super laggy and can crash on mobile it would be a four or five if it was not for the fact that when i hit childe boss fight on the second faze i got stuck on a grey screen while the characters were stuck in an idle animation in the background i do not know why but it happens every time and i cannot continue the archon quests because of it
3,ar here and am getting bored because of how long the dialogues are adding a skip option would be nice most of the dialogues are not exactly well animated either the npcs all have the same set of facial expressions the world quests are not even voiced all this and you have to collect flowers or cook this game is more about running errands for non existent ppl rather than actually fighting and grinding for defeating bosses after a certain point it gets repetitive
3,a good game to let time pass wonderful experience for a new player since there is a plethora of content that you can consume however once you have already gone past most of the available content you will die of boredom it will just get repetitive in farming artifacts with a horrible ratio of good to bad artifacts you will just get stuck in this loop furthermore its sister game the honkai series has way better playerbase treatment this game has lots of room for improvement system wise
3,great game with new concepts and events upgrading constellations of five star characters as well as getting and refining five star weapons are mostly impossible for any free to playplayer apart from that in game primo available through events are really less in quantity considering the number of wishes you have to make to get five star characters and items also the resin refil is too slow and cap on it really sucks
3,this game is so immense that once you start playing it just keeps you on it like a drug i am having just a small issue with graphics because i cannot see some types of water textures like the water in the desert oasis of which i forgot the name below the huge sand storm and some falls on watatsumi island and also actual water like the one under the yellow leaves tree in the new fontaine area which i still did not really explore how can i solve that mihoyo
3,i like the game i would love it if i could skip dialogue that is uninteresting which is most of the story it is mediocre and has more plot holes than paimon says her own name i tried reading the lore to try and numb myself but it is unnecessarily long even with sidequests with npcs that are so irrelevant all animations keep being recycled and why is there more detail in the artifacts and character story menu than the actual story itself are these dialogues just to sell banners
3,game is awesome it have good graphic and game play it takes a while to load sometimes but with those graphics and game play i can see why i had given five start til the last update after the last update i my lost my game and i am having to start over i do not see away to get my game back and i am not sure i want to start over
3,i love this game a lot i play it every day but i have a problem i am at ansencion rank two and it seems impossible for me to beat opponents within one minute and some seconds like from my experience i only take down three oponents and i had seconds left so i tried a lot of times and i never could i know before were only five opponents and a fatui but i beated that but i cannot beat this
3,game is great but after new update it keeps restarting my phone i have even tried reinstalling the game but it keeps getting interrupted because of it restarting my phone i love the game honestly this game type is my fave plus i have dropped alot of money into it lol wish they would fix the issue seriously my phone has restarted times in two days when i try to play
3,this game is fun and i love that i can play and not be interrupted by ads and annoying pop ups for micro transactions every five minutes the storyline is pretty captivating and enjoyable wish more games were like this
3,the game is your average open world gacha with good graphics music and lore with much more to offer it has a decent story and its gameplay is simple but i much rather prefer more engaging gameplay like pgr where you can pary etc however the part which needs improvement in my opinion is the free to playfriendliness although the game is pretty generous when it comes to their premium currencies however as a free to playcompleting most of the games content it still takes months to pull a five star at max pity
3,when i try to load the game it loads for a while and then it crashes and i have to do it over again can you please fix this or i might have to uninstall the game once again thank you i might sue the game and uninstall it if you do not fix the crashing when loading the game again thank you
3,this game good and all but can you please fix the glitch today i make ten wishes and then my phone froze so then i need to shut it and when i get back all my ten wishes are gone and i absolutely left with nothing there is no new character and there is no weapon i wasted my hours on nothing please fix this glitch to prevent the same situations from the other players
3,still the same issues with no resin increase or changes to the artifact rng system to make it better for the player base rewards are also not amazing in game anniversary rewards are a complete joke in comparison to other gachas with my complaints out the way the new region feels fantastic to explore the new quests are amazing great job overall definitely much better than sumeru which was the worst region easily shame the devs ignore the player base holds the game back alot from being
3,it is a good game however it is getting less accessible to mobile users i understand this is not an easy fix also i am not sure why this is happening but sometimes my fps goes to zero and my game freezes i have the lowest settings on my phone my phone is an android i am not how to resolve this issue as i am not sure what is triggering the random freezes also please for the sake of god please make a mora converter that converts mora into primo
3,the game forces you to sit through extremely long boring slow loading dialogues for hours with no option to skip despite people asking them for a such an option for years used to be this issue was limited just to the world quest but now the same goes for events as well no matter how much we ask for they never listen to the users
3,good game and really fun to play but there is one problems the game takes a big half of my storage which sucks because sometimes i have to delete a lot of stuff from my drive but overall i still like playing the game it is just that i wish there was a way for it not to take up half of my storage
3,story and music are boring but the game is fun when they finally add new maps to explore i know it takes time to make new maps but it is worth noting games difficulty is easy if you are looking for a chill game this is good if you want challenge wrong game i left the game for two years now i dunno what is happening anymore
3,would be nice if i actually got to play the game every once in a while every week or so there is an update usually for fixing the most mundane niche bugs you have ever seen megabyte two seconds to download it minutes verifying file integrity and minutes for compiling shaders i do not have that much time why do you think i installed the game on my phone instead of my pc the contents of the game have some issues as well but i will leave that for the in game surveys
3,its kinda fun but all you do is grind do repetitive events do a story line that is not too interesting to me and explore it was kinda entertaining at first but it got kinda repetitive i like the card game but aside from that you cannot do anything with other players
3,decent game been playing for almost a year now its a quite simple relaxing rpg simple but fun combat system and amazing story on the downside i could not say i have enjoyed the game without frustration you are forced to play the game with characters that you do not like and or not your play style because the characters banners rotation is so incredibly slow that i was able to unlock only two characters over almost a year team is four characters just sitting on wish and waiting forever
3,i love this game the story the characters everything but there is one problem it never stops lagging i have my graphics on the lowest possible graphics and it will not stop lagging i have played plenty of games before and this has never happened to me only in genshin if you have a solution then please send inform me love your game
3,i absolutely love this game the characters are fantastic the story is amazing and the graphics are gorgeous especially fontaines but honestly we need android controller compatibility at this point a higher resin cap and better artifact rng
3,good but keep disconnecting constantly a few minutes i am fine then i get a reconnecting to server popup good game otherwise besides the constant network issues i have no issues with other games except this one
3,perfect game but the only reason i give three star is bcs of the limited event limited story suck if you miss it out you will be confused about character death development since limited even are kinda important they should at least add an archive where all of the limited event cutscene was saved in tht way even if you missed out the limited event story you can watch the cutscene to better understand the story if this is added this will be perfect for new and even og player and i will also give five
3,fun until you complete story resin rate sucks and it takes so long to max one character artifact system sucks too there is no way to guarantee a good one like even if it costs a lot to guarantee a good artifact its better than zero chances also file is huge and many ppl may not have storage for the full completed game character models look scuffed also no artifact presets still the music is good and waifus are hot and i still play the game because i am addicted
3,i enjoy the game despite it turning my phone into a heating pad after a few minutes but i do have a problem with storage usage and frame rate of the game i massively prefer the computer version
3,so i think this game is overall very good the graphics the music everything but there is one problem its that the game is based on luck so everyone has to spend alot of usd just to get the new five star heck even some players are even really suspicious and always looking at some really weird things just remove the faceless ayato glitch i do not have it
3,i love this game a lot it is an amazing game but recently when i signed back in from not playing in a few months my game had restarted this is very frustrating for me because i worked hard to get that far then it just not being there i signed in with the same email but it is just at the beginning of the game
3,first impressions the loss of two stars is solely because of how internet dependent this is and how nothing can be done even on another app while the game updates itself hopefully all the time i spent downloading gigabyte is worth it from all the ads i saw i was not quite excited about the fighting not the kind of game i am looking for but i knew immediately that exploring the open worlds is something i wanna come back to i also like the first characters i met paimon and amber so far
3,to be honest i was fun at first but now idek why i feel like its like more boring then usual but come on i have played this game since so its common to play this game every day and getting bored and please add a skip button idc how long you all took to create the story but the problem is sometimes the dialogue is to long and the speed up button or smt is kinda slow for me i do not want to wait there for the character to finish talking but please fix the bugs in the game
3,at the time of combat it is difficult to follow the enemy there should be an autolock system to follow the closest enemy and be able to change to another enemy the camera should auto adjust also in the cinematics the dialogues should be able to be skipped because there are times when they are very boring
3,great game been playing it for a year and a half love the characters i just hate how hard it is to play it on mobile if i want good graphics i must say bye to my storage and battery plus it crashes a lot i got a pc just to play genshin but i am not used to it yet so i usually finish fights on my phone instead
3,confused why there is a control option with only one option cannot use my backbone controller on android appare notly played this on playstation when it first came out wanted to try it on the phone but without controller support i probably will not be playing it
3,i have been playing genshin for almost a year now but i have one problem that is still happening rn whenever i try to log in my account the message you got disconnected kept popping up on my screen my internet connection is fine signal is fine phone is fine but still got disconnect it has been happening for some time now and it is really annoying please fix that issue
3,i used to love this game but after fontaine got released there is so many bugs that happens on my phone and it also make me unable to use my phone for minutes and i must restart my phone just to use it if you all fix the bugs i will play the game again and i might gonna increase my rate about this game i guess
3,the gameplay has gotten very repetitive and the game is almost no functional on mobile devices i have noticed improvement in story and characters since the release of sumeru but there is still so much room for improvement
3,this is an amazing game graphics are good and the whole plot is ok but seriously every time i update the game which takes at least one hour or more there is no difference whatsoever ps can you make it easier to gain adventure rank ty
3,if you get into this thinking it will have good endgame and very in depth combat do not bother it is story heavy with a ton of bloated dialogue and filler event game modes the over use of generic npc models is also absolutely infuriating for said story and dialogue it is purely a casual game and if you want it to be otherwise it will only cause frustration lack of meaningful qol updates when honkai star rail has gotten so many so quickly is also just a slap in the face for the playerbase
3,the game over all is amazing although i am having difficulty logging in every time i turn it off i have to un install it then wait hours before i can play it again i have had this problem for a month now and it is starting to anger me i do not know if it is a bug or something but how can i fix this
3,it is mediocre at best do not know why everyone is praising this game so much there are so many so called genshin clones that are better in every way except maybe the graphics seriously the graphics are amazing and look like a ps game when maxed out on my ultra unfortunately graphics do not make a game the combat is ok but nothing amazing if it had the combat of aether gaizer or honaki impact third i would probably give this game one more star the world is big but empty story is ok
3,i have seen some really really good reviews about this game but whenever i go into the game sign in and press the screen to start the game it says i do not have enough storage even though i have gotten rid of like half of my storage just for this which sucks
3,to be honest it was fun at first but when you reach high adventure rank it becomes really annoying since it is hard to grind for primo especially if your free to play and also some quest are just really annoying there is too much yapping and all that is pretty much it make the slightly convenient hoyo
3,it is an amazing game definitely but it is so heavy in storage and it is starting to affect a lot of people it already was affecting a long time ago to the point where it is unplayable please optimez it better
3,as a player for almost three years the late game content is very boring its all routinary that it makes it all dull still it has the best graphics as well as open world mechanism
3,lately when i try to make an account it will not send me the code i even tried it on the computer and it still says request failed the current evirement is at risk and it is been doing that for a month please fix this also i think that you should give more primo out especially for the free to play players because it is not a fun game if you cannot play your favorite characters i have been wanting to get venti and i waisted a bunch of my primo and i did not get him
3,amazing story line and character models as well as play style but very bad anniversary rewards and primo distribution rate and now the game is slowly becoming a pay win from free play if only they gave better rewards i would have given it five stars
3,graphics is good everything is perfect appreciate that but even all the minimum system requirements are matched i e more then ten gigabyte free storage upto four gigabyte ram and android seven still my game is crashing after a few days and it will not open even if i reinstall the full gigabyte game again help me out please
3,this game is indeed fun but everytime i play the game about five eight minute it will always end up crashing so please fix it i cannot have fun if the game keep crashing thank you
3,game is good but is gated by resin energy without resin we cannot do anything everything is rng and gacha and if you are not playing from day one game release it is better not to start this game fresh as you will be missing out a lot also the company does not give two rats about the players base so issues and grievances are never addressed story is only and after finishing the main quest there is is absolutely nothing to do in this game due to energy issues
3,i love genshin and i play on my phone recently i got an ipad but it only has giga left due to the default system so i got a gigabyte sd card to download genshin however it will not download even though i have transferred it to my sd card which is disappointing because i spent dollar on it for genshin is there any way to resolve the issue
3,why do not you connect to the cloud and bear in mind that i do not have the storage space to play this game and this game requires so much data to play you should take a lesson from youtube channel extra history the playlist of extra credits youtube video adding more stuff of to much content can be a negative impact on the game and this game reminds me of kingdom hearts and legend of zelda i like both i think you and your staff should swallow the lesson sometimes less and not too much is better
3,this game is great the adventures challenges and quests are really fun but one problem i have been experiencing is that the verification code does not send at an expected time this issue has occurred a few times with other account that i have tried to log into i got panicked and i thought i lost the account and it sometimes took days to receive the email i look forward to fixing this problem thank you
3,alright i love the game but i have several issues i am now trying to do archon quest the kabukimonos finale and when i enter the domain this looks like inazuma paimon said and when i click it freeze i do not know how to fix this please help me the screen freeze and also the melusines paint quest it is crash and restart my phone i hope you guys see this and fix this as soon as possible thank you
3,a really fun game with much greater quality and quantity of content than a lot of paid a games these days the story quests can be kind of clunky at first but the lore and characters in addition to gradual improvements over time have made it difficult for me to stay away unfortunately it is a gacha game albeit one where it is never necessary to roll and it can be difficult to run on mobile at times even on newer devices i mostly play on pc for that reason
3,loved the game when it first came out but the updates take up way too much storage everything is buy to win and the puzles are hard and confusing and primo are too hard to come by
3,absolutely horrible dev to player interactions customer support does not respond issues are not resolved unless they cost them money feedback from the community is not looked at very greedy company the first anniversary rewards are actually just a package deal that went free game is fun though but it gets boring fast after end game the main issue is the company edit latter stands but the game is fun
3,it is such an amazing game cute characters and really easy to use but the main issue is how horrendously huge the downloads are i have had to delete more apps for than i have in a whole year
3,overall a really great game but lacking in cooperative activities also various problems i have is the sound effect when you are skipping voicelines it kinda breaks my immersion really small nitpick plus i just wish there was controller support and the characters mouth when they are speaking should be in sync like in hsr
3,good grapchis story is ok but there are some story a bit weird some story always viewing about liyue this is a bit weird if i said you must make it balance my suggest is try to make story in another nation without liyue maybe will make players see this game in other side at looking and please for future make more content now i am very dissapointed as end game player i just login do daily spend resin and then exit game and its just take minute for me to do that please hear my voices
3,i really like many aspects of this games yet i hate many others i love the combat but hate the awful artifact system i like the characters but i detest the fact you have to gamble for them i love the expansive world but not the cursed resin system and so on and so forth overall i find it mostly fun so i suppose i will stick around for a while but i do wish we lived in a timeline in which genshin is not an abhorrent morally bunkrupt gacha game
3,good points graphics animations musics storyline i just like this game poor points optimization in android while first time downloading resources graphic settings must me lowest should be use video instead of rendering eco friendly i do not know what is called but there is option can adjust how far gfx render at least inside domains we will experience fps
3,the game is so cool but i seriously do not know what happened i stopped playing it for a few months due to school and suddenly i open and find my account deleted and i have to sign in again and start from beginning really not fair cognosphere please look into this matter
3,originally i gave this game five star i always get high ping when playing these past few days already tried other games and it has no problem tried other isp and the issue still there customer service did not help even though i already gave them information they asked will return this to five star when my ping get fixed
3,i love how detailed the game is the graphic designs are great only the movements are quite stiff sometimes events and quests are usually fun too the real downside is that primo rewards are not that great and buying crystals is super expensive and adds up to two euros per wish and you need max wishes for a guaranteed star which is really sad for the people who are not rich and we also hope to see more investment in this game seems a bit left out if you look at honkai starrail eg
3,it is a beautiful game the story line the conat and everything else that it has it is in its own league not comparable to another but the updates are so big that many whave to force quit every patch because of space issues many who are willing to adore this game and play this game for a long run i hope the company looks into this this issue has been raised many times and it would be good if hoyoverse actually did something to understand the players and help with management of space
3,i love the game a bunch but i wish you guys would add a skip button so i could skip the cutscenes it keeps kicking me from the app so when i go back in the app it is a never ending loop and i cannot play could you all please fix this i would like to skip the dramatic fighting scenes and stuff because it is messing with my gameplay
3,qol improvements are too slow i accidentally deleted my previous comment for example re dispatching chars should be the same as star rail instead of asking players to click and select each character every time daily commisions with lots of dialogues should allow players to skip after finishing them once the repetition of npcs long conversations is very disappointing i stopped paying due to lack of qol improvements updated my review
3,the amount of space it takes up is kinda rough when you are playing on mobile but other than that it is a beautiful game with lots of different quests and events to do edit well now the storage issue has gotten to the point where genshin is the issue itself i have got nothing else on my phone but genshin but because it is so beefy it is preventing itself from further install maybe you could compact it a little so that it is actually playable on mobile or make some kinda lite version for mobile
3,i just downloaded the app its a very good and fun game so far i am enjoying it but there is only one problem though for me the game is blurry the environment but mostly the characters and also the characters effects they are all kind of blurry and its actually ruining my experience i have tried everything but i still could not get rid of the blurriness so i thought its because of my device samsung galaxy a so please fix it i would really appreciate it if you can but overall its a
3,wow i am surprise at how good this game look control even though i just started playing about minute ago have not tried connecting a ps controller but i hope that it is supported if not then in the next update update playing for about three days casually and found two issues lag and overheating i know i do not have a latest phone pixel xl but to get frame rate drops and the more than occasional freezes is not good did not mess with the settings hope both this issue can be resolve soon
3,it gets so boring in the late game none of the quests match up to what they were earlier in the game and only levelling up once every few months is tiring and boring
3,the game is really good the graphics the story the regions are all amazing i just do not like the gatcha system it is basically gambling and the reason why i am leaving the game
3,the games was so good with all the stories and story lines the animations and all however the problem is there is no lite version for android users and the updates are increasingly huge overtime and a lot of androids users stop playing genshin already because of the gig i just want to address this favor if you have a little consideration for all the android users who are playing we just want to play this amazing game you have without bothering our storage that is all sprinkle sprinkle
3,i love the open world feel of this game i like how well cooperative works when it is allowed the graphics are great the combat mechanics are interesting and fun and there is plenty of good story and dialogue my biggest issue with the game is the heavy focus on time trials they will present a difficult combat challenge and you have to complete it in a sometimes ridiculously short amount of time i now have cooperative blocked until i complete one of these very frustrating
3,things to know before downloading after installing the game downloads resources this may take quite some time it consumes over gigabyte of space on my phone then when you go to play it has to first load resources this can take five minute then you can tap play expect another five minute of wait as it loads your game it then appears to play a cartoon instead of go into game a very laggy cartoon i got tired of trying to get it to start without freezing i wanted a game not a carton i uninstalled
3,it still gives me a hint after deleting alot of things i have tried reinstalling it and restarting my phone and yet it will still give me the hint that says insufficient storage space i have no idea of what to do can you guys give me advice that might work i really want to play the game
3,i like this game but i just cannot play it on my phone because its so big they should really make it playable for all the xbox series and not just play stations because they need to realize that most people cannot afford the newest stuff when they want to play good games like this
3,this game is top tier but my phone is the problem it keeps on lagging also i have been having this problem since i have done a fontaine world quest my account will not open it would only be on the element icon loading screen but when it hit the geo icon my phone would go black and lag and restart the game but when i try to open my other starter account it opened without a problem but on my account with my first ever five star at that need help i am crying internally
3,i have been playing this game since and recently i kept on getting a bad luck i always lost my in my last wishes i bet it went more than that considering it only able to show me pages wanted mona since but never getting it what pissed me off is my friend who only occasionally play kept on getting a freaking good luck for example wishes got x five stars signature raiden wgs constellationraiden jean i spent about wishes to get constellationwanderer feels like quiting soon
3,this game is amazing bur the thing is the insufficient storage keeps popping up even though i deleted many apps and please fix this i do not like it if it keeps popping up even though if i deleted all my apps i am sure it will still pop up
3,absolutely phenomenal story rich and relaxing adventure game however farming is made to be tedious by the devs it is sad that they time gate the domains additionally the drops are rng fyi it will take at least three months of farming depending on luck to just complete a character if i may suggest please make the farming to be convenient for the players because it will be boring since it is repetitive everyday for half an hour same thing everyday just to get the wanted artifacts
3,i love this game but whenever i teleport to fontaine some certain locations it would freeze my screen and turn off my phone and when i try open it back it would stuck at geo logo and the screen turn into black hope you fix this
3,this game is amazing good character designs and i love the fighting but the whole storage thing is honestly getting out of hand also fontaine update is absolute trash it feels like copy and pasted honkai star rail
3,i love this game and i have ben playing it since the release but there is a problem i changed my phone a while ago to oppo reno lite and with this phone i cannot see any graphics like grass ice damage number etc i really wish you could fix this problem also i find the rewards not enough i cannot even get the character i want in one patch i wish the rewarding system was better thank you for this amazing game
3,it is was going good until it would let me get into my account of my tablet i have already had it on my tablet but it kicked me out and said my account is not working or going through i literally have the same account on my phone i have done everything to get back working and it still will not
3,the game is beautiful and fun but there is many problems when playing on mobile especially on androids because it just lags a bunch and sometimes it does not fully load and fall through the map plus with the new fountain update i cannot play the reason being that when i try to join it just freezes my phone and i am not able to join right now it is been going on for a few days and has not been fixed
3,it has very good quality and very well story so far it is been a few years and my current device does not have much gigabytes so i cannot play the game until i get more i wanna make a suggestion that when you first download the game that there is a way to minimize the amount of storage is used and make extra storage optional to download for those that do have extra space that way more people can play the game
3,i like the game but i have made three account due to the same issue after maybe two weeks of playing it forces me to log out the problem there is it does not accept my login after and i know i put in in right based on the fact that i always write my passwords down at this point i do not want to restart again am i the only one having this issue
3,it is a good game the graphics are great the gameplay is smooth it is challenging and mostly free to play friendly but the only problem i encounter are gachas and the fact this game is extremely tedious when it comes to endgame content well its good i play this casually
3,i started genshin because i wanted to experience a game like honkai impact third in an open world at first genshin surprised me in so many ways but after three years of playing i just noticed the game designs are getting more and more childish and weak why characters like alhaitham does not even have a good animation jean and diluc have better animations nahidas representation as a child lyneys animation with a kitten and now neuvillette when will we get epic characters like ei and zhongli
3,best game i ever seen in my life but i have network issue very high ping ms to ms i am sure i never see less than ms ping only in genshin another apps and games ms and the size was very large and game was very lagy i cannot play play genshin impact
3,as usual with any gacha game there is bound to be some disappointment weapons banners and hero constellations are not free to play friendly while you can still use a hero without its signature weapon or lower constellation you need these to fully maximize a character aside from these the game is good enough
3,great game graphics game play and voice actor are all top notch however i would not recommend this game even to my friend because of it is predatory monetization model banner in this game sucks az because the game is stingy with premium currency with honkai star rail we know the dev can do better with genshin but they will not
3,i play this game since its launch the only bad thing i faced was the updates each one gets bigger than the one before last weak i updated the game the update size was giga and now another update giga double the size and if we talk about pc version omg i deleted it pc you guys really need to fix the massive update sizes please to me its bot about the free space i have i have alot but the internet its not unlimited its limited am from egypt and i do not want to stop playing this masterpiece
3,it has been three years and i am absolutely still impressed with how this game still has more to offer truly a great game alas i have been feeling down and does not have much motivation to play the game due to burnt out and playing every day since release and has been regularly not login in since last year and only sparsely every now and then really hope that hoyoverse can give more anniversary gift truly a shame that it has been three years and they still lose with other game developers
3,absolutely love it just did the new update and now it always says failed to connect to server no matter what i do tried with my wlan tried mobile data nothing works anymore
3,the resin cap is killing me raising that or the the regen rate of original resin would be a massive help for every player honestly handling original resin like honkai star rail handles trailblaze power faster regen rate something like reserved trailblaze power would be a huge improvement for players
3,i have downloaded everything i have downloaded the data for it and it is not letting me play i just got the game yesterday and it keeps saying i do not have any internet connection or data even though i am in internet connection range of a building that i am staying in and it keeps saying that can you guys fix this because i actually do not want to uninstall it
3,for multiplayer you can combat together but you cannot unlock teleport waipoint and if you join another world you cannot open chests it need an update on multiplayer
3,it is good but it would be nice if they could increase the number of items that can be placed in the sernitea pot because i want to make mine look nice but it keeps saying it is full when it is super empty with only itemss
3,the game is fine but the grind to level characters really feels like a low point in the game for me first you grind for gems to roll for characters and then you grind for materials to level the character once you get them
3,hello i cannot open genshin i only see a black screen i tried restarting my phone but it will not work and whenever i go to the sewer when doing the fointaine quest i crash can you give me some advice on how to fix this i do not know if it is a bug or my phone and also i really like the game hope you fix this bug i am not sure if it is a bug though
3,pro this game has the best graphics i have seen on mobile con the mobile controls are terrible there is controller support but only for ios version you do not have enough resources to upgrade anything many characters need to be constellationneed seven copies to be usable pulling one copy does not get you anything but a dead weight character
3,the game is good i am not including the end game part of the game in my review i but the writing is so horrible writing as in pacing it is and only next version will we get more lore about mc lol reminded that there are only three more countries to go
3,update they sorted it out wish it never happens again but i do not trust it anymore fontaine it is amazing so go check it out their client service sucks i have told them many times about my issues with the american server after every update and they never answered back i have lost all my progress again so now i am done with it
3,everything is great and this game suitable for free to playplayer anyone have chances to get five stars character the disadvantage is we cannot skip story please make a button to skip story or anything that delaying our play times this is always make me turn off while playing this game we cannot skip we cannot let the story run by itself argh please dev grant my wish i do not have time to read your story just want to enjoy doing mission without storiess
3,the graphics and music are amazing but the quests are ridiculously long and that had made me play less the quests include more dialogue from npcs rather that the playable characters and the mc on top of that paimon would repeat what was just said and that for me just ruined her character fontaine is just around the corner and i can only hope the quests will improve fingers crossed
3,its a fun game to play but when you get to adventure rank and above there is a lack of things to do unless there are events i have completed every quest in the game exept for one or two that are locked behind commisions and have gotten everywhere exploration exept sumeru which came out on the day i am writing this so overall fun to play but has a lack of things to do at a higher adventure rank it also takes up way too much storage so its harder to play on mobile devices
3,the game has basically become mid quests after quests becomes so repetitive very very long lines no skip buttons cannot put more furnitures in the serenetea pot no wonder why most players do not care about it why must you purchase to get more rewards in bp just why you must unlock new places via quests which makes it boring rewards feel like nothing in the end the artifact system makes sense yet unfair star rail is better than this nice bgm though only can bgm make me happy
3,i am a mobile player and the geo symbol will not load i waited for five minutes and it would just shut the phone off i tried to reinstall it but it is still will not work it all started since fontaine was released i also encountered some bugs where i cannot see the wall but i can climb it please fix this immediately hoyo i really want to play since i am addicted to this game
3,very good game the only problem with it is that it takes up so much storage space to the point that i almost had to stop playing as someone who does not have a pc or laptop i think they should really start working on that
3,for my experience it is a really great game with great graphic dialogue gameplay and so on although i have encountered this problem i cannot use my google account to log in i have tried downloading it again and it did not really work as i have said it is a great game and i wish to play it more i just hope you could fix this problem
3,the game is well done people on pc can enjoy it best but on phone not it also causes you to lose focus and spend an astonishing amount of time in the game primo are hard to earn late game and there are specific characters that are good and bad making this game quite unbalanced in terms of team comps and character abilities overall it is still good but keep yourself in check and try spending less time on it than most progressing fast is bad
3,i love this game fontaine has honestly been peak exploration is satisfying and i love all the characters i am excited for the next region also another dainsleif quest in the future three stars unfortunately because the game is basically unplayable on mobile better optimisation would be extremely helpful on tablet it runs smoothly though
3,going down from five to three start fontaine update is great but new archon quests are about investigation and dialogues story line is great but continuously roaming around from charcter to charcter is getting annoying new ascension quest is too hard
3,stars only for graphic it remind zelda controls are not optimized and the history is to long everything need to stop to listen someone to much text more action and less history
3,beautifull graphic nice back ground sound and nice charcter everything nice i give three start because of the artifact system there is a a lot of character to get good artifact need to farm for few month when to build other characters
3,its an amazing game but please update for chrome i stopped playing genshin for a while and when i came back the game kept crashing at the compiling shaders part
3,good story good graphics and character designs but i have only one problems in this game no skip button i do like the story but sometimes i have no time to read text and dialogues
3,fontaine was an improvement but sadly the last arc was a bit disappointing you are still trying extremely hard to cater to male players if you focus on a male character for once please do it properly the cool fighting cutscenes were underwhelmingly cut short just to show a boring honkai design waifu also why does neuvillette not have both arkhe when he should be able to control both
3,yeah uh what is up also have you guys added any bluetooth controller support i am still not seeing it and i am pretty sure it would be a cool detail to add i am just saying that i do not want to keep accidentally using my specials just because i missed the attack or run buttons in addition could you guys chill i literally cannot even play without a pc because of how big the app is now
3,this game is pretty cool the only problem that i have with it is that to actually play the game the actual download size is giga you guys need to find a way to minimize it because that is absolutely insane for a cell phone hopefully you guys minimize it or i may have to uninstall it when other games come out like ff ever crisis on september th
3,this game no ask for me it is real life anime game but i delete this game because i cannot level up if i want level up i want kill boss he look like dark blue cube but i cannot kill him because he heal him he is self and i do anything thing use any character possible but i cannot kill him because i do not level up so i cannot have enough power to kill him please genshin impact fix this problem now i rejoin this game let me see this bug fix or not if it is fix good game need five star
3,the game is nice but whenever i go in the underground of fontaine i lag alot to the point where it takes me to a black screen for ten minutes and then crashes please fix this problem i am on mobile
3,i have heard lots of fun things in this game but when i downloaded this game it says i do not have much storage but after i deleted most of my storage on my phone it still says that its not enough i tried to download it last year but it did not work that time as well
3,i played a little of the fontaine update and it is definitely my favorite area in the entire game i am wondering why fontaine is so luxurious even though liyue is the mora capital also we still do not have enough map pins
3,it is a very cool game and much of fantasy there are lots of characters that are just amazing but one thing i really do not like that you have to pull like you need so much luck to get many characters as a free to play free to play or if you want all characters or many you gotta pay unless you cannot get them and the way many players think is they focus so much on genshin that they forget everything else so it basically could brake you physically so please be careful with that game
3,i want to play this game more but the game keeps crashing again and again after ten to minutes while playing i am currently playing on vivo y i hope this problem will be solved because i am really enjoying the game
3,the gameplay is fun storyline is engaging it gives immersive experience to the player but it is not a free to playl friendly players really have to spend money if they want to have descent characters weapons and artifacts this is a gacha game after all my main problem with this game is the server i lag a lot i am getting ms ms of ping even though i have good internet connection this is very annoying please fix your servers and please optimize your game for low end devices
3,very epic and free to play friendly update after a year i am genuinely addicted just like botw with more characters it may start a bit slow but it really picks up the gacha aspect may drive others away however even low rank characters can deal insane damage most four stars are better then five stars i have taken off a star because the company still has not listened to the players when it comes to fixing the rng with artifacts or boss drops they also do not care for their fans at all sadly
3,why cannot people refer to us as aether and lumine instead of just traveler whilst in the text it shows our selected username it just feels weird i get it that each of us should have our individual usernames but that is good enough only to be recognized by a unique name by other players it would be much more immersive if npcs referred to us as aether lumine instead of traveler and our selected usernames besides the travelers have their own voices why cannot those be applied in game convos
3,ngl games great but my storage cannot keep up maybe something like having the choice to delete quest files before actually entering the game like these files take up like gigabyte and my phone is kind of in the sweet spot of being able to download the game after quest files are deleted and cloud is not a good alternative for obvious reasons
3,very fun game at the start rates are pretty abysmal though if you are looking for a game in which you get the characters and weapons you want look elsewhere with decent luck you can get a couple you want if you save for an entire year do not play the game if you want good updates that are not just focused on dialogue not actual gameplay if you want endgame content this game sucks if you want to not grind for hours on end every day just to lose your this game sucks do not recommend
3,love the game but i am dang tired of how artifacts rolled it is so rigged when you just want that your fav character to have good stats literally impossible with the rates of actually getting it and rolling think it is time for another good break it is very frustrating like they even been lowered stingy mane stingy
3,i really love this game only downside is its very expensive like spending dollar does not give you any guarantee for pulling characters unless you already build pity and the events are not new player friendly as a beginner i am missing out a lot of events because the quest where can we get primo is only available on new contents
3,ive been playing the game for a while now and i have multiple account but for some reason i am not able to log into other account or add a new account the main account on asia shich i created using google it keeps saying login failed and when i am trying to use one of my friends account it does not let me add the account at all its a good game but if i cannot log into my main it just gets a little boring
3,this game is amazing it can keep you entertained for hours has beautiful graphics and does not even have ads i like the open world factor the characters landscapes voice acting all of it i really recommend it unless you have a not very good phone although you can also get it on pc overall great game i have turned it down to three stars because they still do not have that much black rep but it is definitely getting better
3,really expansive and fun mobile game not sure why there is not controller support in game currency is stupidly expensive starting from nothing you are looking at dollar aud for a chance to get a character or weapon you want assuming you have the worst luck that is dollar aud for a character and weapon or hundreds of hours of playing the game it is a shame as i would normally be happy to spend some money on a free game this is just way too expensive for what you get
3,i am rating it three star after the fontaine update a network issue occurs every five minutes of game i hate it i cannot complete a single quest because of the network issue note network issue only on genshin impact if i switch to youtube or any other platforms network is fast as it always but only in the game it show reconnecting and after reconnecting the game do not run after ten minutes i reopen the game and it runs only for five minute and again the same issue i believe you could fix this issue
3,i had the same problem regarding the fontaine update when i was doing a quest underwater my screen suddenly froze and crashed i had to turn off my phone and turn it back on when i tried to login back i was stuck at the little geo in the loading screen and then my screen gone blank i hope you can fix it quickly
3,a good game definitely even though almost everything on console pc is better mobile still holds up for when you are on the go and do not have access to the superior resources to play
3,takes up an insane amount of space for a cellphone game it is getting harder to play on my phone because of this will not let me play until i update but do not have space on my phone to clear sounds like i will be taking a break and putting this game down
3,genshin have lack of endgame content to do and do not communicate as much as it needs to the community for getting the game better also the genesis crystals are too expensive for countries like brazil
3,i will give it a three because there is no support for controller i play with my tablet and this is insanely hard to do without a controller nor keyboard support
3,i love genshin the events are epic cool characters good f ing music and decent story but the promblem is that you guys need to add more resins slots or just minimize the countdown in resins edit weapon banner pity system sucks
3,the graphic everything is super nice in this game but there is one thing its not good its the graphics i need a solution my device is huawei metpad se can you guys help me i love this game but because of the graphics i cannot play it please someone help me
3,i love this game but please save the progress between different servers most of my friends are on the asia server but i am on the america server and i wanna play with them please
3,good game overall i have been playing this game for one year now but biggest problem is they need to decrease the size of the game for mobile users it is around gigabyte in mobile and that is insane
3,pay to win characters story nightmare not completely open world great to explore fun combat the story is good but ridiculously and extensively exhausting way way to many words no skipping content locked behind story save forever gamble to lose the character you want do the research some people have spent dollar in one month on characters pay to win the game is obtaining characters weapons artifacts not story everyone quit for a week when you lose the character gamble
3,this is an amazing game i know so far but there is some kind of crasing in my game that did not letting me complete the quest we will be reunited so i am not able to progress through but i loved this game
3,it is amazing i am adventure rank but i have no sound in genshin my volume and in game setting are max but there is no sound and it is irritating me a lot because i cannot hear anything
3,fair copies good things from botw the only thing they have not copied is good side content and short dialogue gotcha is actually pretty good and fair game gets repetitive and side quests are terrible
3,the game is good the adventure and some stuff are nice when i played it for the first time it was smooth and enjoyable but when i got to liyue it was laggy and i am experiencing some framedrops even though i changed my settings to lowest it does not change i am hoping that this will be fix soon
3,i play this game on both pc and playstation at the moment i do not have access to either and decided i would try it out on my phone hours at least a full reset of my phone to get rid of unwanted data and one gigabyte sd card later and i am still being told i do not have enough space i have been told you need space ranging from eight to giga of space to play i have nearly the game is great but it rivals games like cod in the amount of things you have to delete just to download it
3,i recently just logged out of my facebook account and wanted to log back in again with it but facebook tells me that sorry something went wrong i do not know what is wrong but my internet is working fine and it is been four days now and still has not been fixed i am missing out on my rewards in game please help
3,my opinion has changed as cognosphere helped me fix my issue i am glad that customer service is not that bad turns out it takes around gigabytes but aside from that i hope this is as good as honkai starrail which i do recommend if you like this
3,i like that game but i cannot enter it took three hours but i cannot enter so i cannot play i play genshin impact with my sisters phone i hope it works and people can enter hurry that is all but it is a amazing game
3,controller support please so many people have been waiting since launch for android controller support i am half tempted to give up the game entirely because all i have is an android
3,a good game but i have been trying to log in all day yet anything i have tried reseting phone reseting internet connection trying with mobile data etc is not working how can i fix that
3,not really good i got the game and when i load it it goes to or and the app just closes on me i am not sure if this a is a bug or something else but yea
3,giga this better be a great game some phones cannot even accommodate this size so far three stars it is taking almost three hours to download
3,i purchased a package of genesis crystals and when i went to convert it to primo it did not even go through and when i went to try again it showed that i did not have any more genesis crystals i want my money back or the genesis crystals back
3,pls add controller support on android please be mindfull that there are also android player who love to play with controller and not use any app to play genshin impact with controller this is bieng bias on android players not having the oportunity to play with controller
3,pretty good i would like it more if the buff geo but the latest pach has been the best in years there needs to be characters buff
3,the game is amazing but when i do the dragon quest my screen freezes and nothing works please fix this bug
3,there is nothing engaging to play when there is nothing to do sure i love the consistent update but it is every days and it just all the same with nothing new so at least added more permanent content that related to your character strength the main reason why people play this game is to fight using their character not listening to bloated unnecessary dialogue three years already i do not put much hope i probably quit when wuthering waves comes out
3,i cannot get in and play anymore it just crashes as it is supposed to load in it is a bad kind of crash as it basically locks my phone as it does it as if it just restarted kinda spoilers for info on why i cannot load in i am stuck at a part in the fontaine world quest near the statue that makes you go underwater
3,personally the game is amazing it is fun wnd i like to explore all the different placed in teyvats but the problem is that i am a mobile player so the data is the real problem and every new update my mobile gets fuller with each update thus making it heat up a bit it would be great if hoyo could start figuring out ways to make it so games will not use as much data or make it so everyone can play normally even if they have mobile
3,i will say this directly the game is really addicting but every update feels like i also need to upgrade my phone especially sumeru since i quitted for that sole reason since my phone just keep crashing and cannot even maintain the game for ten minutes worth of commisions which is time consuming for a casual playthrough edit and also just my opinion i recommend adding keyboard support in android i badly wanna experience playing on keyboard using mobile hope my review get noticed by directors
3,i loved the game but ever since i updated i can no longer play because of the insufficient storage problem and i do have a lot of space in my phone
3,everything is fine except i never have enough space for the updates also the game takes up all my space also can you add abandon quest cause i am stuck on trails in tianqiu please at least make an option which reduces quality or lowers certain things to make it smaller i do not think i can play once every region is out
3,it has good story and fun gameplay but the story is only gets good at the end of a chapter and for combat there is almost nothing in the endgame just one mode to utilize your built units and enemies are mostly just damage sponges and do not have unique and fun ways to kill it and i am a player that has played this game for two years so i know what i am talking about
3,a good open world rpg with interesting story beautiful world but after three years the character design is monotonous and lacking with only five types character
3,i absolutely love this game the graphics art style the story and everything is amazing but it takes up way to much space on both my phone and computer though i am still want to play it despite the space it takes up
3,i think many people would agree on this add options to only download necessary resources base on the settings of the graphics this way the game would save up more storage space and this will be useful for players especially that is on low end devices
3,every single thing is well detailed everything is so good but three starts becuase too much talking rather than action put a skip button while talking
3,genshin impact is fun and awsome game been playing since it first release the only issue i have is that my genshin psn account is link to an email that i no longer have access to since deleted an i am having trouble deleting the account
3,i edited my old review you have been doing well but please add the skip button or at least a fast forward button for world quest i do not want to read uneccessary dialouges which are long af add increase the limit for resin please there are too many bosses and domains
3,good game but i have a major issue recently i tried using my google account to log in as usually only for it to say log in failed i sent a few emails but got no reply at all for the recovery form
3,could you at least place a skip button on all the dialogue scenes not all of us are into the story we just want to play the game and bot be stuck on character dialogues
3,there is one problem in that survey that gives x primo there is no it just goes up to and does not say or later the game in general is great but the survey is not in the first question just fix that if you can and i will be alright but keep up the work
3,game is good but no option to skip the cut scenes takes too much time to explain the whole story and i am not the kind of person who reads the plot
3,reason i gave this a three star is because i keep having insufficient storage problem again and again but i have perfect storage please respond to this and email tell me how to fix it thanks ss edit thank you for responding to my review i got it now i will get this app soon when i have my new device delivered
3,its a good game but on mobile there is a glitch where you cannot use two buttons at the same time you cannot attack and move you cannot move and move the camera if someone knows how to fix this please tell me
3,no skip button for the endless dialogue and no endgame while the journey is incredible not having something to work towards after three years feels bad
3,playing the game since releas the game is great i love it overall but damn having a new character is hard as hell in gacha i never won and always hard pity what the hell is even that seriously spending my money just for that damn thing can you fix that mihoyo kun
3,it keeps saying game fike verification error whenever i install it on my pc and keeps restarting the download no matter how many times i deleted and redownloaded it may i please have some help
3,i have never been so done in my entire life this game was awesome but for the fact that when i do not wanna get the character and then get them makes me so frustated and for the characters i wanna get i do not get them gosh hoyoverse i thought i was your son
3,it is flawless and amazing but when there is a new update it logs me out of my account and i was upset because i had been adventure rank and it made me restart and i lost all the money i spent on that acc
3,everything is good quest characters banners but please take a look at how mobile players will manage with the storage as the game is alread gigabyte and i have only gigabyte left now
3,it is is a good and an awe game but it is conditions for installment is very high it is around gigabyte and it can increase in future its lag in low end but mine is gigabyte ram and gigabyte storage it is very lag
3,it is a bit hard to use for newer players and i am glad it is not like pick the male treveler if your a male and pick the female traveler if your a female
3,in serenitea we have a bed furniture but there is no action sleep why we should have a bed if we cannot sleep on it plaese if there is an action to sit on a chair i wish there is also an action to sleep on a bed and we animals in our serenitea but we please make an action to pet them or feed them please make it controller support for android phone i wanna play this game with my gamepad
3,it was very wasting time for waiting verification file i am play in pc and mobile but in my pc so very wasting time in one hours just for verifycation file to many update and but small update but in verifycation it is so loong for waiting
3,it is good but i think we should remove the sufficient space on genshin impact because i was clear the storage and its show again i was trying to play with my friends
3,i love this game but can you guys please add a login with google option on all platforms the game is too big for my phone but i really wanna play i want to be able to log onto my account on my computer
3,the game is alright it is just eat up lots of space but it is now good also it is a bit laggy to my two phones i use to play this but it is somehow fun to play
3,love the game play and the character design is amazing but i cannot play the game anymore because it takes up to much storage and is getting bigger
3,i have always loved you game but one day you all had to change the ascension quest and now it is getting harder for some players like me to ascend you all please bring back to old ascension quest it was much better
3,it is sad that star rail is far more better then genshin now i wished they would be like them it is ok to add more end game events and give us increase resin star rail has higher resin cap man i wished they add all the things in star rail to genshin impact please put it in genshin impact
3,i have not really seen the game yet i am still stuck on the loading screen it is annoying it takes longer then minutes please change this
3,i cannot play the game i suggest if your on a phone do not download it because i cannot play because the storage i deleted lots of apps just to not be able to play but i have seen it is a good game on the internet so there stars
3,this is my favorite game so far it has a huge open world to explore so many pretty characters interesting lore a card game which is really entartaining and so much more but the events could be better the events are really similar most of the time which makes it a little boring also the game takes a lot of space it also crashes a lot and also i cannot see my damage i really hope you fix this one because it is really annoying overall if you have a good phone download the game
3,when i was in liyue killing slimes and trying to get the ball thingy it fell in the ocean and i cannot swim under it is so annoying
3,give skip dialogue option to the story please i do not have a long time to play watching people talking is not for everyone
3,the game is heavy if your using phone when playing this game can take half of your storage because there is a lot of update
3,material grinding and talent materials are too hard and annoying to get and my lucks sucks so bad which i cannot even get a single artifact or weapon neither a good character
3,great game but it is sad that it does not run smoothly in devices that have powervr gpus it does not show the damage numbers and does not load resources properly
3,it is okay but the controls are terrible i wish i could adjust the buttons on a way i am comfortable with it plus add a controller setting in android just like in ios i am tired of using third party apps to integrate my controller on the buttons
3,the game is amazing it is visuals characters and gameplay are awesome as hell the only problem are the rewards that are way too bad the commissions do not give you the needed primo for even one pull the quests take too much time and again give almost nothing as a reward the events are cool and the developers constantly introduce new mechanics to the game the third anniversary rewards we are awful
3,game is very fun and good based on experience educational entertaining and very detailed the world quests and story quests are also good fun detailed and it makes so much sense and sometimes confusing which makes me make some of my own theories only problemo is the fandom community its kind of getting toxic i hope hoyo take care of that next
3,the game itself is good the graphics are amazing and the gameplay fits a casual playstyle however once you get past the starting point things get boring very quickly the quests feel like a talking simulator with very few amounts of actual gameplay the challenge that the spiral abyss presents is just inflated health bars and the gambling part of the game gets in the way of the flow of the game very frequently i would still recommend trying the game out also devs gimme more daily resin
3,umm i give this a three star cause it really needs a lot of space and i almost remove all of my apps and it just keep on saying need more storage please fix your game thanks
3,yes i like the genshin impact but i will only give it three stars because of the nahida and kaveh glitch that hoyo has not fixed yet and i want it fixed because they say it is permanent and the glitch cannot be reversed even if log in again or redownload this is scary because if they do the glitch the heroes or other characters may not be able to level up because of the glitch hoyoverse if you can see this i hope that you have fixed the glitches that other players do not want to happen ty
3,the game is amazing and good to play highly recommend but i have to say when i try to update the game it is not allowing me to update it and when i finally updated the game the background music was so glitch it sounded like a robot and now it is hard for me to play wish i could sad i cannot but other than that you should definitely play just be careful so you do not break it
3,the game is good there is alot to explore and to do and so is the details but the reason i gave it a three stars is because the account that i have been using for thus past few months disappeared i do not know how but all my hard works also disappear which means i have yo restart everything i lost interest since i have to restart all i did please fix this
3,good game on the surface but when you dives deeper and play longer it is rotten to the core there is no point of building characters when you can stars abyss the events are fomo traps you cannot play them once they are gone no endgame content the developer do not care about the playerbase the artifact farming is horrendous the resin system is very limiting and they are stingy play at your own risk do not expect anything especially qol update from them
3,a fun but serious open world game make sure you choose one game to play because this game requires alot of time to enjoy some features need to be grinded or paid for but if you work hard you will progress fine happy gaming update very disappointing about the lack of android controller support meanwhile star rail works fine
3,i burned out at least if you can just add skip button wich is simple for you to add it then i will stay you know not everyone will have that much time to hear those long conversation anymore as time pass except for some which mostly content creator oh and i am not even counting those puzles which is a plus plus time to do
3,if every time the game moved or locked my pov i set a dollar aside for travel expenses to go to the companys headquarters and scream at the devs then i would have been there several times so far also i would not be able to play this game because i would have to be working hours per week to be able to afford putting all those dollars aside or i would be able to pay voice actors for the world quests of this game because somehow this company prefers funding nuclear reactors than paying voice actor
3,as a mobile and an old pc user i really do reccomend this game to people who do not know what game to start playing one thing is when i joined on my old pc at everything started to lag and honestly this was not enjoyable i lost storage at the update but then got a new phone and started playing i cannot wait for and fontaine high hopes on genshin impact
3,i love the game been playing since stories graphics are amazing but every update seems to grow larger and larger leaving my phone with no space at all i have enough space to update yet it says i do not i cleared my entire device to just update this game nothing happens which is a disappointment
3,its a three star because i used to play genshin and everything was running smoothly and everything was but now it laggy and glitcthy and the trees are i have also tried reinstalling it and closing it out to reopen it but nothing seems to work so this is my last resort something else i need to add on is i tried to create a new password for an account that got signed out and it said could not connect try again even though i had internet connection so i am just very confused at this point
3,i personally adore thisbgame i love it love the characters the open world game experience but the game just takes up too much storage and with each new update my phone just cannot keep up with all the new places to explore i have been waiting for the newest region to experience and its taking too much space i eould love to continue my travels in this game but just cannot keep up with the new content
3,great game unfortunately file size is too large for my phone giga i am unable to play on my phone or buy primo because of lack of storage uninstalling they really should look at removing game assets as you complete questing and such warning if you plan on playing fyi please get it on pc first otherwise you will be locked to your phone app in terms of buying in game items the game will not let you purchase things outside of mobile if you started in mobile
3,the recent update of fontaine has been really good but i encountered some recent problems in the game were i was doing a quest in fontaine my game suddenly crushed and even though i already redownload all the files i still could not log in my account i have been playing this game since release and this was the very first time it happened to me please fix it hoyoverse my phone has been handling this game for two years
3,for desktop for mobile it is not very optimized for mobile you will need to download like anywhere from gigabyte of data after downloading the app from the app store and only half of the entire story has been released i would hate to see how much storage this game will cost in a few years i would not be surprised if it hits gigabyte
3,update death by dialogue i use to love this game the story was immersive and it was about the game play now it is all overly long irrelevant side stories and fillers pot and card game are a waste of the developers time get back to what was good exploration plot and fighting
3,good characters scenery voice actors pretty beautiful music combat gameplay bad the most unfair gacha system i have ever played in my whole life absolutely loathe it so hard to earn enough primo there is too much to put here
3,absoloutely fantastic amazing characters flawless scenery brilliant quests i just wish that i could transfer my data onto other serves in order to play with my friends it is a pain having to redo everything please make an option for us to be able to transfer our data onto different servers
3,gensin is pretty cool there are many characters to get graphics are beautiful and you can play with friends it is so entertaining that it can just pass time when you are bored but then again all you do is commission over and over and quests are very long and confusing
3,i have been playing the game since the game has undergone four major updates but like all games the game gets pretty boring once you complete all story quests and world quests the hunting and farming of materials every version update this is the predominant problem including events hosted it would be great if we could fight other players even as an event it would certainly bring in something fresh
3,the gameplay is decent story is decent the lag is bcoming quite bad nowadays though even with gigabyte of ram and smooth graphic settings another annoying thing is that paimon would step in everytime the traveler wants to speak if that is the case making her voice less squicky and high would be good
3,there are three things i would like to see in this game better character design i just wish i could use my honkai impact characters to explore genshins beautiful world speaking of the speed in which we are allowed to explore it is too slow give us a sonic boost or something auto mode like star rail
3,the gameplay is fun and can be played without paying i have two specific issues the first is the gacha pull rate is incredibly low compared to other games you have to spend serious money for each character i understand it is a gacha but it is hard to even make a first purchase when you know it is like dropping a dollar in a well second issue is graphics on the google pixel tablet my pixel six is less powerful and the game runs better there than on the tablet which runs other games great
3,pls please pls provide skip dialogue scene button sometimes i do not have enough mental energy for all that dialogues often fell asleep phone died then i hv to restart these dialogues all over again it is a great game and the voice actor does great job but i prefer to go straight to bonking enemies on the head
3,the game is kinda weird on mobile but it is really it reminds me of zelda breath of the wild i love the elemental reactions and i hope there will be cool characters to try out please make it so you do not have to download of of gigabyte which takes really long consumes a lot of storage space
3,the game is good but the thing is that the representation is bad and the character designs the character designs are not really that bad but their skin tones are too bright i have a really light skin tone and it is the color of the dark skinned characters if that would be fixed i would give five stars
3,it is pretty laggy and has some missing chunks using tecno spark it takes me a while to load the game and even walking around and switching characters is taking time i already put the games settings into lowest and still laggy it is a good game i need to play on a different device for better quality and i hope there would be a chance for the size of the game files to be smaller and the developers to at least make it playable on my part because i cannot enjoy the game if it is so laggy
3,unfortunately this is the second time i had a problem with the game when loading in it will go close to look like it is done but just goes back as for waiting it out i have for about minutes still did not work hopefully that can get fixed
3,it is really fun but asking per ten pull is unreasonable for the numbers set in crystal top up not to mention the extremely large amount of pills you have to do in order to get anything nice it also does not make sense to continue getting a character when you have already maxed it out
3,i love this game but i have had to restart the game three times already i have gotten so far in each of my account and i have to restart again so much time wasted on a game i am about to just uninstall the game because i do not want to do it again as someone who spent several hours upgrading characters and collecting primogin this is extremely annoying
3,overall the game is great the world design the puzles the story among others but currently what bothers me the most about the game is the character design which is simply rubbish there is no representation at all it is almost like you are afraid of melanin or something seriously sumero was inspired by countries where the majority of the population is brown or black and how many black characters did we have in sumero exactly none please go back on this and change for the better
3,so its been almost three years and i gotta say they have improved some things the game has gotten more content and more interesting characters sadly they still seem to be holding back on so many potential changes for instance artifact layouts increasing the resin cap better artifact rng etc but for now at least we can enjoy the new region just wished mihoyo would stop holding back on those qol updates man
3,good game with astonishing visuals my only problem is why tf does the game take up so much storage and gigabyte another problem is loading screen with the elements takes so long so overall this is a star game not too bad
3,i just do not get why you will not add controller support for android why though i literally bought a controller thinking it would magically make my game play much smoother i spent fifty bucks and i cannot get it to work with this game but if this were an ios i could use my controller seriously that is messed up i am not going to buy an iphone just to use the controller so you might as well add controller support for those out there like myself
3,while yes this game can be fun at times other times you are left with nothing to do and feels like a chore to play whiled paying money is not in your face all the time it is still very pay to win unless you grind everything which will also leave you with thothing to do till the next update you will have trouble getting any characters you want and the game is now boring cause you have been playing the same characters for almost a year
3,okay updating my a review a little bit played the game a little bit i still think it is a great game i have tried to change the graphics but i do not believe high graphics are supported on android devices and when i try to turn them up my game was buggy laggy and unresponsive
3,i like the game very much it is very fun and enjoyable but there is a quest where you have to find runes with an aranara and i cannot complete it because i pressed the runes in the wrong order can you please fix that
3,still no android controller support my old iphone has controller support but i guess they do not care about android the game is standard gacha fair you can get lucky and pull some op characters or be like me and spend hundreds to pull mostly junk oh well i used to enjoy the game and do not mind throwing them some money but no controller support years after release when the game is on consoles and has controller support on ios is inexcusable
3,i have been playing this game for more then two years now but just today the app was crashing whenever i try to open it on my device i recently bought a new device and have been playing on this for two months now but i faces this problem just today please look into this i love this game alot and this is the only game i reside in
3,one of the free great games to play that is available at playstore although i hope hoyoverse would listen to its players wishes because as the game progress it is getting more and more difficult it would be hard for us players who do not spend money on the game for various reasons so i do hope that it will be fair soon
3,best graphics and smooth gameplay but the problem is it is a high files size and has a server problem and also it consumes a lot of battery charge and does not play offline
3,it is a fantastic game the storyline and the open world adventure is amazing the only problem i have is whenever it has an update to install through the playstore like version three zero for example the update never downloads first try there is always a problem
3,the game is amazing really it has breathtaking graphics the music is top notch and the characters are spot in my problem is that my genshin does not have any grass damage text and ice and some of the characters faces does not have any lighting in it actually this really bothers me slightly but please hoyo can you fix this
3,this game is amazing and so nice but as a mobile player i do not like how the logging in screen is so long and annoying and when i go to another app for a few seconds my genshin resets and puts me back to the opening screen it pisses me off so much
3,the game is really great i love to play with it all the time but my only problem was it was taking a lot of space of mine the new version just came and i really wanted to keep playing but it was taking too much of my space
3,the events and characters are fun to play and all but it frustates me that android only have one method of playing even ipads have two options touchscreen and controller i hope that keyboard and controller will come as an option for mobile gaming in the future
3,genshin impact is fun and sort of easy to play i understand that i do not have internet connection and all but i am tried of constantly lagging when my connection is perfectly fine and this eventually leads to the game crashing and i was also forced to delete and redownload the in order to update it i have played genshin before but i could not really play on my old phone but i got a new one a few days ago due to the old one breaking and the new one it works perfectly fine
3,would have given a higher rating if it did not take up so much storage it is supposed to be a mobile game yet it requires so much i have not been able to play due to how much storage each update takes up and we have not even finished half of the game yet quite disappointing since i have been playing since and would love to keep playing but i cannot update or launch it
3,good day i would like to raise a concern regarding a top up purchase issue when i attempt to top up it tells me to top up using the device used to register the account this is a major issue because i barely have access to that device now also i fail to realize why the game is requiring me to do that and not just let me top up with my current device please fix this i also would like to get your reply on this please thank you
3,the games great overall but i always exit the game when i keep on playing i even need to restart the ones you go on partys although i do think it is my storage or my internet connection but they are all good it is just the game so please fix this
3,the app keeps crashing when i try to run it usually while loading sometimes right after starting the game sometimes i have to try times before i can actually get into the game
3,hey why there is no option to move the on screen buttons for better control because every player has different style and you are restricting them also the total size of the game is gigabyte and you missed this thing your game how
3,amazing game but need more in game events not just an event that stretched to a week and have to wait everyday to unlock new progress on the other hand i played since it is first release but even until now i do not have good artifacts roll
3,i would have given five stats but the thing is that loading takes forever plus at the start of the game it is confusing please make the loading shorter everything else besides all of this it is a great game
3,game looks and feels great lots of things to do but with no game pad support for android is very frustrating game would be five stars otherwise so if you can play on a controller get this game
3,taking for too long to load but still good like when it says press to begin i pressed the door and then it is taking to long to load like really long it is just like it frozen but the game is still good hope you guys fix this problem if the game
3,here we are almost three years into this game now mihoyo hoyoverse has repeatedly pissed off its player base does not seem to really listen to our feedback or at least they do not care and many players such as myself are struggling to stay interested most of my friends who played have already quit i am barely holding on hoping that hoyo will pull their head out of their collective adollar and make the improvements and changes that we have been begging for but i have a feeling they will not
3,the game is good but the storage it takes is impossible please make it need less storage i have to delete so many hour pictures and games just to be able to play one update it is rather annoying
3,i totally love it the best game i have ever imagine to play but there is an issue every update need a big space this game is over gigabyte right now is it going to take all my space do something about it please stop new versions and stop asking for more space it seems endless and please add a button to skip those boring dialogues
3,the game was fun indeed but there is a certain point where travelers have no nothing to do in the game and likely would log off for example for high adventure rank players they are just gonna do commisions and condensed some resin because they already completed the game and there is a lot of problem inside the game where the resin cap is while on star rail is on hope the developers see that many players struggle mostly free to playplayers
3,i have been interested in this game but i cannot play it because of error or insufficient storage space error my storage is clear i have tried ever thing to fix it but i can find a vidoe on how to fix it on a chromebook and it is making me mad so if some one could help me i will take all the help i can get
3,this game is so good but i hope the artifact will be fixed i have been unlucky with the artifact for almost a year
3,very good game but why takes so much storage and every updates added more gigabyte without updates and it is still online game can someone tell the developer to use compression apk
3,it is a known problem but having fewer chances to pull the character you wanted is giving me more reasons not to play regularly pity system is also very frustrating as it may vary from zero to pulls it would be better if even it is at least to pulls to trigger pity
3,amazing story with great graphics but needs little work on animation while dialogue convection as compared to star rail
3,genshin is a very wonderful game but it is becoming boring i hope you can add some more useful settings like more sensitivity limit and more useful dodge mechanics because dodging is very dull and pointless because of very op shielders and reduce enemies attack intervals to give us time to react and i hope you can add some camera distance option while sprinting and better targeting system like in star rail and hi to avoid confusion in battle and more camera combat options just my suggestions
3,genuinely really love this game i have been playing for over three years now i am starting to get burnt out on it but that is bound to happen with all the repetition very gorgeous graphics and all but especially for mobile players the amount of space it takes up is ridiculous i recently had to switch to my playstation because even my computer did not have enough space for it i do not have the best computer but if it did not fit after deleting almost everything that should say something
3,the game and new update is beautiful and amazing i do enjoy exploring around but the issue i have encountered was when i teleport to a certain waypoint then my game crashes i had to use another device to open it again and teleport away and then in the middle of the archon quest the second part where we are underground with navia and the headquarters my game crashed i do not know what caused it but i hope it gets fixed
3,game can be a lot of fun lots of exploration and stuff to discover and experience great visuals gameplay and music but events are mostly copy pasted and fontaine did not bring much needed qol updates either low levels of powercreep which helps if you do not want to spend a lot but i really do think the abyss evolution has been one of the worst systems i have ever seen in any game still a good experience i recommend people try
3,decent game has lovely character designs and character stories cool lore can be fun to fight if you play right fun cutscenes and stories but i feel this game could have been way better if the devs listened to the community like we need a character index skip dialogue option for minor quests less storage use a pocket version would be good more daily resin fairer gacha system better artifact stat system better character banner system time distances between characters are too long
3,i have a problem with the game because if i download the files or something if you download the game it will tell me to log in and download it but i downloaded it but it tells me to login again and i have to download it again that is the only issue
3,i wanted to download it but it will not load and it keeps saying i have insufficient space even though i deleted so many memories and photos videos and even apps
3,i tried exploring fontaine and came across the underwater water current my screen stopped moving and i could not do anything to my phone my gigabyte is gigabyte if that is the cause but overall i only used gigabyte i tried to press the home button but i could not even scroll for the options to scroll i also tried turning off my phone but it took minutes to turn off and when i turned it back on my wallpaper was black whenever i open genshin it is black screen with the water current audio
3,so somthing happend when i got the dendro ability its very triggering the voice audio of rana and the others are not working i verified and it says there is nothing missing please fix it
3,idk what is happening but once i like go in from the door i am just stuck there white screen then it says connection lost but my connection is fine i do not know why everytime i try play genshin i can never go in
3,i gave five stars because this game was so much fun back then but now i feel genshin becoming sucks and all the things inside the game is suck as well a lot of things happened but genshins devs are just doing nothing if it compared to it is sister game from the same company i do not know if its still becoming suck like this i just gonna stop and uninstall thanks for everything
3,good game but whenever you try to use the europe server my screen goes black the turns off having to start all over is not thrilling as one day the server worded for me then suddenly did not please help me out here
3,i think the game is overall solid and needs more polishing the game has very good soundtracks and a decent story that could engage me i think the gameplay is pretty fun and the open world is really beautiful the issue that it has is the dialougue in story tends to repeat the thing that has been said before and the whole artifact system which is mostly rng based is pretty bad imo but overall i think the whole game can fix these things and even then it is a good game even with these issues
3,the worst i cannot even register just make it where you can choose login or sign in and it is saying i cannot play because i have to much space i just got this phone do not play
3,visuals are great but that means it does not run well on non high end devices
3,anything needs resin while stock resin is very limited and even dropping artifacts from the domain does not guarantee that you will get what you need even if you spend a lot of resin i beg you make this game easier and more comfortable to play because anything needs resin to make we as players who do not buy items in the game find it difficult to play this game at least add resin stock with a shorter recovery time than before
3,i love this game alot but for some reason it keeps kicking me off the game so i do not get away i have enough storage for the game and do not want to delete it
3,the game is pretty fun and i enjoy every single minute in it but when i wanted to play with my friend on the american server i have to change the account and lose all the data i really wish mihoyo would change this so that i would change the servers without losing progress
3,it is a nice game i had not played it yet because my screen is still loading i gave it three stars because of the how long does it take to update the game the app though am not mad i swear
3,after i updated it for the third anniversary it will not let me play it keeps freezing or crashing or lagging please help
3,this games really good good story characters details and more the controls are simple too but the events and mechanics keep being the same and i am slowly burning out
3,oct first time i joined now here i am adventure rank having to hit hard pity every time as a free to play i am getting sick of how awful the pity system is becoming for the free to play please improve it like star rail
3,not bad but mostly farming for items and cannot do any emotes are anything similar gotta pay for good characters not pay to play but pay to get good stuff
3,i have been playing for a while and its quite fun the only reason i am giving it a three star is because the wish system is quite tedious as you can do so many wishes and only get one five star like me and if you are at a decently low level it is difficult to get primo
3,i enjoy the game and game play but doing maintenance right after an update so i cannot get on and do not hing need to work on better timing with that bullshit
3,love this game but not entirelly because i cannot play it in my samsung tab with an ps controller and i have seen that ipads can do it
3,i would love to try it but gigabyte is too much takes so much time to download for an resource download
3,this game is frequently stressing me out i fully understand and acknowledged about this open world feature but nevertheless the storage requirements for this game is still insane too much rng you need to have a good device or at the very least decent ram for this game to be performing well enough to progress farming become tiring when you are in high adventure rank the community is even worst either normal or they were the most problematic person you ever meet in the fandom customer service suck
3,the game is fun to some point the main story is kinda good but the problem is it tells the story like its explaining it to an mentally retarded person for example you understand the situation and expect the dialogue to end but then paimon comes out and says omg that is this then so the game is overly explanatory and the edgy accent of the characters makes me wanna puke except those it is a pretty fun game with grind cycling and some story with it mihoyo please do not continue like this
3,no controller support for android ios has controller support while androids have been neglected there is even a key binding option for controllers that is blank because androids cannot play genshin with controllers i will give this game five stars once an update reveals that androids have controller support
3,it is a really good and enjoyable game i like it but genshin impact have very annoying issue and that is the games refresh rate players have to play in hz in the year i do not know abut others but my eyes hurt when i am playing in hz and that is such a shame for this game
3,i usually play this when i am bored but there is two things that bother me here first is as someone who picked lumine as my mc it is kinda sad that she is barely in any official arts i know aether might be the canon protagonist but i am pretty sure putting lumine in one official art will not hurt second the game gets boring after having quests that only give primo even after hours of work though aside from those this is a nice game and the character designs and personalities are cool
3,i have been playing for three years now i wanna speak up my only issue the only issue i have is that there is not any way to fix it it just sucks that you cannot change the gender of the traveller once you picked it i chose lumine yet it felt rather off when the male traveller is considered the main character of the game it is immersion breaking and a simple change can fix that and would also be good for those who wanna pick the right gender they wish to see in the story cutscenes
3,awesome game just love the graphics and design three out of five because of the storage problem i am a mobile player and having issues in maintaining the storage my phone is gigabyte and taking more space with each gigabyte update is not possible for me i had to unstall it for that reason but i really want to play it and i am keeping touch with the latest update i think a lot of mobile players like me is having the same issue so please do something about it i really want to play the game
3,i agree that this game is very aesthetically pleasing but it lacks in all the other departments you have to constantly grind for materials to be able to achieve anything there is so much to discover and to do to complete everything the game has to offer probably takes hundreds and thousands of hours and it is quite demotivating the story is shallow the characters are predictable the puzles are basic and repetitive the combat is just smashing keys the cooperative sucks too
3,have been a loyal player since release absolutely love the game graphics is top tier voice lines and voice actors are top notch storyline is absolute fire only issue i have is with controller support please add controller aupport for android devices the phone heats up a lot when playing at a decent quality and prolonged gameplay heats up the palm as well the only thing that we all need in genshin impact for the perfection is the controller aupport
3,i played the game on the computer before and let me tell you it was beautiful from the graphics to the gameplay i loved it now the issue i have a low compatible device which means i can download the game and have it on low settings and it works fine but the issue is that game is too big gigabytes for a game come on you all can make a game as stunning as this but cannot make a light version for low compt devices you all are better than that so strive to be better
3,it keeps saying something is wrong and nothing is wrong with the game it will not let me play anymore please fix this
3,as an android player it is very glitchy so i would have to use other devices that do not consist of phones because they are too glitchy but apart from that genshins new region is beautiful the graphics in this game is unbelievable it is amazing
3,the game in general is great the graphics and maps are awesome but the resin system is awful the cap in is so fast and cannot acumulate any further that the limit
3,i suggest that there should be a menu wherein we can resize the joypad in phone because its too small sometimes i accidentally press attack instead of dash
3,this game is better than i thought it would be going into it but i still have mixed feelings dailies feel boring and drawn out characters and thier gear cost too many primo in game resources and there is not much to do in late game other that spiral abyss i do think genshin is a good game though and worth trying even for people who do not like gacha games
3,please bring fps option to android maybe consider the middle ground fps since the ipad pro gen gigabyte ram could not hit fps on the lowest setting while the gameplay which is an optimization limitation because for sure minute series chipset in general can handle fps or fps and my ultra could handle higher than fps with alternate gaming performace and does not heat up as much as iphone running at fps max i average around fps showcasing the game developers lacking
3,love this game but my hands cannot handle the game play on my phone i am an android user can we please update the system to allow android users to have the ability to use controllers please i went and bought a controller so i could play this game more
3,it is a good game with best of best graphics sound effects but the stories are very slow most of the grinding characters and artifacts and weapons especially are too hard please make it easy
3,the best one i have played yet with such good graphics even though it is big it is really addictive and entertaining but there is one problem and that is whenever i fight dvalin the camera works fine but the moment i see dvalin do an attack it somehow freezes my camera rotation which makes me unable to fight it properly is it a feature or an issue to be solved
3,the download size is too big could you please make it smaller i am on mobile and i only have giga worth of storage and it is like or something like that
3,fix dehya good music good combat good environment but bad power balance each character bad ranged weapon system such as bow and catalyst auto aim is in trouble and dev never care about it i played this game since it have launched but right now they do still not fix it i feel like i waste money everything in game is gacha including artifacts i hope one day dev will make random droping better story in game is good for patch story patch is so rush and unreasonable
3,this game is addictive af but i came to play a game and am forced to watch just as much cut scene cartoons as there is game play time if i wanted to watch tv i would have just watched tv how about a skip option for those of us that do not care one bit about the five minute back story cartoons every minutes of game play
3,i have been playing genshin since may but by time it is getting frustrating the enemies are too aggressive even for new players the artifact system is driving players insane and the character drop rate is driving everyone ballistic it takes long to actually understand the game and world puzles specifically in inazuma and sumeru are next to impossible until you rely on youtube the lack of primo is annoying ps it gets really boring once you finish all the major quests
3,easily burned out free to playplayers cooperative is useless you should make it into a new domain or space where players can interact together online grind together and grow together not solo
3,the game is beautiful and as far as i know a one of a kind in the gacha space but that is itself the games downfall the lack of late game content in the beginning led me to taking a multiple month break now getting back into it with new content it does breathe a new breath but i can only wonder how long it will last the amount of free primo you can get is somewhat lackluster through the game considering the of characters there are collecting oculi is probably the worst part though
3,i feel a real world in this game i like the game and also i having a problem in graphics please can this improve the game performance in snapdragon i try to buy the requirement but this only the close to the requirement i cannot find other like snapdragon i having a laggy game play in the graphics but still play i will wait until the lag fixed i wish this can help me to solve this problem if can but if not is still ok i just live in poor country this only the device that i can use
3,if you are expecting rewards do not play it the characters are good and the gameplay is fun but the devs are so obviously greedy they barely give anything for their anniversary and this is made worse by the ridiculous gacha system not to mention the game frequently develops bugs that they are slow in patching there was an incident where a hacker was able to delete people out of their game that terrified loads of players that they took far too long to patch it will not stop crashing either
3,i cannot even log in without the authorized thing i have been trying for a while and i still do not know how i already contacted support but none replying
3,it is a great game but every time i see water it is weird and it shoots blues at me sumuru do not know if i spelt that properly is the worth my screen is covered in blue most of the time and i had to follow my sister through sumuru only using the map
3,i cannot access the battle pass menu since i updated it any solution for this thank you
3,the game is good overall but the wishing system is rigged it said a five star character in draws or on your draw but instead i got a five star item so now i only have four stars i want a five star character but it is rigged
3,the game is good and all but i have a big problem when it comes to logging in i was grounded back in february and my mom deleted my genshin account i recovered it by logging back in to my account on her phone she then deleted genshin impact and i cannot play for months up until now and today when i got a new phone i downloaded genshin impact and logged in to my account i thought all my progress are still there but when i played it restarted please help me bring back my genshin progress
3,i love the details the animation the characters you get it is amazing but it is a little hard and the update load is so long i think i had to wait for a hour until i could play the game but it is a pretty good game i kinda recommend i hope you have fun playing the game
3,sadly the game is missing out on end game content i have been playing since the beginning and i took my first break from the game during sumeru it was so full the area was so annoying to explore and combat was really bad and clearly a third or thought the game quality is good and it is really fun in fact until sumeru i was having fun it is only until sumeru i got tired of it because of the repetitiveness and focus shifting away from combat to the point that combat is completely ignored now
3,greatly enjoyable but with some flaws still no controller support on android huge install size on the gameplay side i would say it rather enjoyable the questing is only slightly above average puzles are fine and the exploration and world design quality is top notch in my opinion character design is quite nice as well though acquiring them is quite the pain if you want only characters and you only get a character like every wishes my average would recommend fairly free to play friendly
3,it is a really great game and fun as well i have been playing for maybe a year already and i have not thought of quitting at all there is this issue though where i would wish and then in the middle of getting the rewards the game just exits when i open the app again i can neither get back my primo nor get at least what was already shown for me to recieve happened twice already but only recorded the second time i also checked history and it is just as my gems vanished into thin air
3,its not letting me in everytime i go on the game it gitches and kicks him out when it reaches geo or my phone freezes and does not work please fix this bug over all i love the game but after updating it i cannot get in
3,this game is great i used to play it all the time and i got really far but i am not able to play it anymore because there is not enough space on my phone no matter how much i uninstall or delete off my phone which really sucks so because of that it is a three stars for me
3,there is two things kind of pushing it down for me the amount of storage that you need to play is literally ridiculous it is a great game but i have not been able to play on mobile since last year because of the amount of storage that is needed on laptop the game is functional a bunch of things have issues though i do not currently have a mouse and without one i cannot do a few some what important things and what is worse is that i cannot change it in the key bindings
3,i am really upset this game was absolutely amazing before but now when i try and open it it keeps telling me that i have insufficient storage space even though i am clearing the data and cache i have even tried uninstalling it twice but still no luck i do not know what to do
3,great game and everything but actually it is too big for a phone game pc version is enough for me
3,good you need to fix some bugs and lag issues on gigabyte ram even it is shows smooth it is still lags so i am giving three stars
3,great game but having resin per hours is ridiculously low if i want to progress and build a character considering your rng on artifacts it could take years it took me two years to build one decent team characters now i have more characters
3,the game is absolutely beautiful but the problem is the quests are way too long and a bit on the boring side i have been playing the game since launch and yeah now the game is burning me out in simple words this annoys me more than anything lack of end game for the devs endgame means enemies with a ridiculous amount of hp with no attack pattern and mechanics that are made to stall time no good events and the main problem is the game is way to big for the tiny amount of content it has
3,i have heard such good things about this game yet after deleting half my photos and apps i cannot play it due to insufficient storage space if i had one suggestion please lower the amount of storage required i cannot write a review about the gameplay because i cannot play
3,i definitely like this game but the thing is if you are ah free to playplayers it is gonna be hell to you if you are planning to get a super strong character in the gacha i already draw eight times ten all i got is all four star weapon i did not even manage to get a five star character it is like gacha is rigged
3,this game is great but i hate their wish system you have to pull times to get a good character and instead of getting the character on the banner they give you someone like keqing i wanted childe not keqing please at least give the characters more reruns i do not want to wait two years until the next one thanks
3,it is kinda fun but maybe if i had a better device it would be better plus i do not like that i have to delete everything just to play the game but other than that it is ok just not for me
3,this game is good on console and computer but horrible on phone if you do not have a console or computer do not download genshin and genshins story is good at the beginning but slowly it is gotten worse and worse and genshin is a very time consuming game i feel like you could spend your time on better gotcha games like honkai starrail or maybe not a gotcha game or something like that
3,genshin has been a fun game to be honest but since the fontaine update i had some problems with it and it was not the storage it takes up my problem with the game its because if i load into the game and the loading screen with the elements and then its now loading to the geo icon if that makes sense it takes forever and then my phone freezes and restarts for some reason i have been trying to fix it for days now and it still does not work i hope you guys can fix it i am a android user and oppo thanks
3,great game it has beautiful music solid graphics and lovable characters i would love to give this five stars but the storage amount is so ridiculously high that my phone does not have enough space for it sad to say my genshin experience as come to an end after two years because of a storage issue
3,good graphic and also great story game of traveller and god there land what they lose and what gain but it is this game negative point take grinding of month of month it is hard content but reward are are not great as game sometimes mihoyo lie about some game event and reward huh so it is better play for story and relax using in game features
3,the game is great but it takes up so much space it is unreasonable i have had to delete so many other apps and photos just to continue to play the game almost felt like it was not worth it in the moment
3,entertaining cute characters very catchy game make sure you have time because you will get stuck to this game edit game does turn a bit stale after rank or so where the free to playor average players grind for characters and other stuff turns really boring
3,i give three star for some reason good storyline good story environment time grinding needed for the artifacts and level up its a gacha game need good pull spend money map too huge to explore a lot of quest to do chara background interesting lot of storage used story quest since update i cannot download the update and wondered am i the only one who cannot play after this update as everyone can see there is a lot of than in my review please check
3,game is amazing but as soon as i open spiral abyss my network starts to lag and give ping even though i am connected to giga network that provides ping when playing any other part of this game i tried it a few times and every time my network started to lag as soon as i entered spiral abyss and starts working normally as i exit it
3,i love this game i am playing it since and i like the plots and story in general the game is good but is that too difficult to make android user happy why cannot we play with controller too we already have to suffer for the bad grafics
3,the characters designs are so good but sometimes my game just lags and genshin just closes like the app closes the loading screen takes too long as well but it is a good game though
3,i recently downloaded genshin while in another country then i moved to my home place and i was logged out without my own knowledge and i had to log in again only to find that i had lost all of my progress in the game my phone has two sim cards from different country and the phone itself is an oppo the game was updated to the new version please tell me how to restore my data
3,finally tried this game not being able to choose how i want to start my game or replay the character selection cutscene and i instantly lose my interest and i am ready to uninstall this game
3,the game looks really good i just wish i could get past the loading screen it always just says insufficient storage space after i have deleted tons of things please fix
3,graphics and character designs as well as voice actors are all amazing it is not five stars simarly said in other comments because of the long dialogue i literally skip through everything that is not coloured blue cause that means it is important another frustrating thing is the pull pity i am pulling about times on each new banner depending on how many primo i have but tell me why i am not getting a star or i keep getting godamn keqing also make getting primo a bit simpler i am not paying for them
3,hmm yes i like this game so much it even suck the storage i really like this game but my storage aint liking this app hoyo please do something about a bug in fontaine at first it is ok and all but lately i cannot get in the game my phone screen will froze and malfunction my screen always stuck at the geo simbol i cannot do anything at all
3,a great game but a big l on no controller support for android this is in theory very little development work to add as it is already supported on many other platforms rumours online say this may be a deal with apple to restrict that on android but that would be quite disappointing
3,deleted my old review a good game and all but the storage it is too much for a game and i am sure many players quit because of that it was nice while it lasted but not even my sd card has gigabyte left so i cannot play anymore see ya when i get a new phone genshin
3,i absolutely love genshin but recently i have been having a problem the update is too slow to load my internet connection is good but for some reason the dounload speed is kb per second it is been weeks only around hoyo please pls please fix i need childe it is his banner rn i will update this when fontaine is loaded
3,please add skip dialogue button some of us does not have the time to go through the whole story and just want to enjoy exploring
3,i like the game i played it on my playstation but i tried on my phone this device and it keeps telling me i have no storage i checked my storage and i still have gigabyte i did everything and it keeps telling me this please tell me how to fix this because i really want to play and enjoy it like my friends
3,why there is no controller nor otg support for android users i started on pc my pc is now broken hence i cannot play anymore now i am stuck with mobile controller which i am not fond of neither controller is not supported while ios had it i cannot give anymore high review
3,great game overall but it is too big i have been trying to clear up storage space on my device for days to make room for the new update but even though i have at least megabyte of storage left it will not download super frustrating
3,whoa so so so so much dialogue oh my god why so much talking and with no option to skip the dialogue they make you listen to every last word should be an option to skip but it is not somehow
3,i really love this game but when i am doing the we will reunite quest the game keeps glitching out when lumine has a close up of her sword and then the game kicks me out i really like genshin impact andi spent a lot of time on it so i do not want to stop playingit becauseof that
3,this game is probably amazing but the thing is sufficient storage you probably think it is my problem to deal with but it is not really i freed up alot of space it still says i need storage it is really annoying
3,it is a good game but if you do not play it often it will log you out and there is like different quest but beyond the mid levels and there is like a whole bunch of fun things so yah bye
3,the game has used gigabytes on my phone friends tell me that its only gigabytes however when i tried to continue downloading the resources it says that i have insufficient storage i have nine gigabytes left on my phone i am confused how it says that its insufficient fix this bug please
3,this game is good pretty nice even but it takes too much space is there like no way to compress files gigabyte for a mobile game is kinda alot my friend has new phone but it has only gigabyte total i remember there were some talks back in the days about cloud data or something
3,i updated the game two days ago and it consumed giga of data today it updated again and it wants ten giga of data it is too much why did it happen again when i updated two days ago please handle it i am very angry because i cannot enter the game
3,phone slow phone cramped pity rates and resources to get a five star are lower than the abyss love getting those three star weapons also top up prices for the resources they give is depressing but since it is a gacha it is perfectly fine right welkin moon is your only friend if you want to use money efficiently on this game dollar for almost the same amount of primo as the dollar dollar top up without the first time bonus only downside is that it takes a month to get those primo
3,mm the cooperative is unbalanced but fun the game as a whole is a bit unbalanced
3,genshin is fun combat is very interesting than most games but it is not fun when it takes hours and i say hours to complete a single archon quest and it is not even rewarding the game is very repetitive just doing the same thing over and over again i wish there was more difficulty because the game is really easy there is the world level but that only to takes part when you rank up and wish there was a penalty for dying like loosing some materials upon death this is an my review and my opinion
3,i have been playing this for around two years and i have finally decided to quit it is understandable that the story has to progress but it is too much to catch up on and there is too much to grind if you are a no lifer then sure play this but for people like me who has gotta give out their attention to the real world this is not my cup of tea plus the reward system is kinda messed up so i suggest you all to not spend too much money on this game and finally touch grass it is good
3,my main account on genshin is bugged i cannot enter it its been a month and the fact that there is a limited time prize from klee and a crystal ball right now and i cannot have it because of this bug is annoying i play on mobile and my phone is not a gaming phone so its laggy and i cannot see grass but still at least extend the event so i can get it after the bugs fixed the bug started about a month ago when i was exploring underground caves in fontaine but it is still a good game
3,please hoyoverse please fix the ping issue in asia server i am playing the game from india and my ping is somehow always over ms even though in any other game my ping is constant ms and secondly add the control customization option as i am four finger player i would love to move and attack by left hand thanks
3,this game is nothing short of phenomenal and magical the details the lore and the music are top notch but having played it for three years i can point out its downside too firstly its a tedious game to play if you are not into open world exploration and reading because there is a whole lot of unskippable story secondly the size of the game itself is unbelievably big going into gigabyte in mobiles as of today and lastly they do not really put much thought into the players welfare and happiness
3,took the time to download this ginormous pos only to find out android has no controller support also it needs constant strong connection even when playing just the campaign seems like the devs were on crack when brainstorming this game
3,game is good but app developers are bad game downloads data and takes space but forgets about all previous data downloaded and opts to download data once again what about data taking space
3,it is just perfection if you guys stopped making us download in game resource downloads ps it could be the end of their four braincells if they have gigabyte storage phone like that is impossible to have this and i know that genshin impact took so much effort and time if it is downloading for days and still not ready yet so big game
3,the games extra data is way too big for my internal storage if i could simply put data on my sd card i would be fine the games extra data took up basically of my phones internal storage i would simply transfer other important apps over to my sd card but i cannot with the latest update is size that was the last straw if i could simply put all this extra data on my sd card i would have more than enough storage for this game and my essential apps and i would not be so critical
3,good game overall giving three star because it is been i do not know how long and yet your game still does not support controller for android online says yes but only option under controller setting is touch screen somehow you get five star and i will come back to play once it is a bit easier to travel around a gorgeous huge map you guys have
3,idk about this update but i keep installing all games that i i would but i i only if three games i deleted two games but it needs more i mean what but i if genshin impact and war robot that does not make any sense
3,please tell me what and how to fix the bug this has been going on for years i never got to play this game because you will not tell me how to fix this please tell me
3,you know i buy a capable phone to play this game and yet play i properly but the problem is the controls can put please the tap version of sprint on the joystick for easy dodge so that we can press the attack fast
3,can you guys please make the character pull chances a bit better i literally spend so much premogems and i got not a single five stars in other hand my friend who just started playing got xiao on his first ever ten pulls
3,lots of bugs and lags all the time i freed so much of my phones storage and it still seems to give me a message saying not enough space to download while updating the newer versions every time a new update comes if i wanna play the new one i have to delete certain apps and free up storage even though i have enough of it this game takes almost gigabyte as it is now i will soon get a pc but i want to continue playing in mobile as i feel comfortable that way but please fix your bug issues and lagging
3,the gameplay itself is pretty good the graphics was so good the design of the characters places and the sound tracks are pretty good as well but the problem is when you reach the peak of the game end game it is like logging in do commission use resin log out i myself as an end game player i am experiencing this type of loop for about months right now i am adventure rank and playing the game more than eight months i guess and i have spent money on this game genshin impact can improve
3,the gameplay is nice and the banner released is pretty much good as in not too fast nor slow the gameplay allows good coop however the resins system is bad as it is too slow to generate the resins almost everything depends on the resins another thing is for those who do not have phone onwards you can kiss goodbye to the game as the ram requirement is high even if you set to the lowest graphic you cannot play the game well
3,rather than going the way of hating or simping i have chosen the middle road for my share of criticism the good the devs at mihoyo are indeed doing a bang up job from a gameplay and story perspective the visuals are great the story gets to be very intriguing a few hours in music is brilliant and exploring the world is an absolute treat the bad whoever is mandating the rewards for the one year milestone has failed to take the fanbase and their loyalty into account an utter failure
3,fun gameplay for a time but then it gets repetitive art is beautiful but it does not look like you can customize the characters outfits and gear only non commetic stats world looks good but is mostly empty game would run fine on normal graphics settings then crash when i got to a major town dropped graphics to lowest and it would not crash in town but would still crash randomly have a moto z so my phone is about two years older than when i played the game so it could easily be my phone
3,you should allow everyone to play past events or at least watch the cinematics even without prices beginners are missing the story of certain characters because those are not available anymore story should not be linked to limited events also the whole find every single oculi mechanic it is not beginners friendly and in general jumping from the game to the interactive map is dumb resources should appear on the in game map
3,genshin impact has captivated millions of players with its immersive world and engaging gameplay however like any complex game it is not without its flaws one particular area that requires improvement is the occurrence of bugs when defeating childe i have experienced various bugs one of the prominent issues is related to childe transformation mechanics occasionally when transitioning between different phases childe may get stuck in an animation loop or fail to transition altogether
3,good graphics and story line seems pretty good love how the downloads can be done in the background user interface is excellent points for making this type of game on mobile device i could think of wow as a comparison could not give five stars because of how much resource the game requires even on default graphic setting the game and screen laggs long loading time and disconnects from the server too often samsung galaxy note
3,i have waited an hour for the download this is the most awesome game i have ever played you can swim get drown climb a mountain rock with bare hands and slide down you can jump and run it does have a button for running and jumping most rpg does not have most of the this but i have only played it for like minute my phone started hanging up lag is inevitable i have to wait for like ten minute for my phone to go on menu i have to force my phone to shut because i cannot exit unbelievable
3,i was absolutely thrilled in the first month of playing this game but as i got further many of the bigger fights became less exciting and more of an aggravating task a challenging battle should be engaging not simply hard all on its own especially in the case of main quest battles yes even with four five star gear i want this game to be the best version of itself but if this is how the game will continue it makes you want to put it down for good
3,beautiful game and i am sure the story and battle systems are very good but i never got to experience them as during the tutorial i fell off a cliff and could not get back up again three stars for graphics and the storyline up until the part i fell off a cliff the missing two stars is not the games fault but would recommend playing on a computer so you do not be like me and fall off a cliff
3,its ok i like that its mobile compatible but its really laggy and has no controller support whatsoever i tried to connect multiple controllers wired usb to usb constellationand bluetooth pairing and still no response the graphics are beautiful for a mobile game the soundtrack and gameplay are also notably good but if you guys could modify your game in the future so it is game controller compatible as i would prefer to not play the game with touch screen controls thank you
3,well the graphics are amazing and beautiful the mechanics is pretty easy to use and well managed i like the lore in this world and the story but i was not able to see the cut scenes because when it is played it was always stuck and the narration audio crack somehow i will hope that this will get fix soon
3,this game is awesome in terms of world building characters and quests i would give a five star review if not for the problems i have noticed that make me hesitate to invest any time or money on it recently the game force closes crashes frequently and usually occurs mid fight during teleportation or when leaving an event domain building after the recent windblume event update i have for the first time experienced extreme lag to the point where i do not even want even do enemy mobs or bosses
3,this game is really good designed the graphics are very good even in the lowest settings but two rings are really annoying you cannot skip the dialogues the are very long and in every third mission you have to travel all along the map for example from monstadt to lyuie cities the first one is in the northern of the map and the second one is in the southern west of the map because of that i am rating three stars and after your adventure rank or the game is not interesting anymore
3,i have been having fun albeit stockholm syndrome esc in my current living conditions but fun nonetheless however i have been having massive issues with framerate on the lowest settings with a relatively decent phone it struggles to reach a constant fps and hits a solid if fighting dungeons are fine it is roughly fps in dungeons anywhere besides indoors or underground and the framerate tanks and i love taking photos but you cannot change the time mid photo and it bugs me a ton
3,this game is pretty fun to play i am a newbie so i came late in the update which has a problem for archers in mobile since i cannot move the gyro aim so i just had to manually adjust the character to aim they fixed it this update and i can finally practice aiming however there are more bugs now defeated monsters and mobs do not dissipate they just stay there as well as interactive animals also enemies with half their hp stop attacking so i cannot finish the mission
3,hello it is a very good and interesting game in the rpg style and the graphics and character design are very good and beautiful and it has a beautiful story but from its weak point lack of voice with our group mates it is difficult to get a star character which depends on our luck from time to time there are various updates there is still room for improvement
3,my game was great i play it on the pc too but since the recent update the game does not work on my phone i have a samsung e it worked flawlessly before but it keeps getting stuck on the loading screen then crashing i have cleared the cache date and completely reinstalled the game and it did not fix the issue please fix soon i am missing out on daily quests due to not always being home on my computer but i always have my phone with me
3,needs an improvement while in combat or running or jumping the camera automatically moves to unnecessary directions and distracts me where i am going and what i am doing the trees and grass that appears behind the character i play in front of me does not fade opacity and i cannot see what i am doing where i am going and who i am fighting the navigation button is locked fixed but i am used to a more free moving navigation button which makes it easy to move dodge please please fix this issue
3,love the game but rate three stars because of clunky controls some actions or quests need to be repeated because character ends up jumping to its death every time it is close to a cliff or you have to manuever in tight high places you barely touch the screen and it goes running in the wrong direction other that that very good game
3,the game is great i find it to be really fun the characters have a good background story the graphics are excellent soundtracks on point and cooperative gaming makes things even better but in terms of in game purchases prices are absolutely ridiculous for countrys such as brazil i strongly believe they should make adaptations to the shop depending on the regions reality and considering as how i have seen other comments abording the same subject i hope this changes
3,i will start off positive the combat story and adventure aspects are all really good buut the gacha rates suck and the abilities are cool but a little boring to use i think the game would be a lot cooler with less realistic abilities fire slashes can only be done so many times that being said great work for a mobile game
3,an excellent game i have been playing since launch and have thoroughly enjoyed the journey i have two reasons for not giving five stars for one there used to be good communication between the devs and the community and now there seems to be nothing the second reason is that the most recent archon quest from felt extremely rushed plot lines felt unfinished plot holes were left unaddressed and character development was bad i am hoping to see better stories in future updates
3,the game is really nice everything about it is amazing from combat to graphics and the scenery is amazing even in low graphics however i have been seeing a lot of people especially people who are using the phone brand vivo not being able to play for more than minutes or more than two hrs i have been experiencing this hope you guys can fix it soon but over all the game is amazing i love it hopefully i can play it soon
3,a great game that makes me want to invest some time into it however makes it near impossible to do so due to the energy system resin this makes especially less linear farming such as artifacts extremely lengthy with very little rewards if you get unlucky overall i would still recommend it however would also make clear that this is not a game you can easily pick up and get everything quickly alone due to special five stars that appear like twice a year at best you are okay with grind go for it
3,the story is nice though it has plot holes characters have good designs but some are quite underwhelming in combat beautiful graphics the pity system sucks espicially the weapon banner wich requires you to lose two times before you can get the weapon you wanted after reaching endgame you do not really have anything to do other than daily commissions events and spending resin wich generates very slowly cooperative mode does not have much things to do
3,so to be fair i play this on pc as well since you can link account and play on both the game itself is great an enjoyable one major issue for me is optimization on mobile i have an lg v and it is like playing a slideshow on the lowest settings frames does not even help it is unplayable for me on mobile but great on my pc i like that i can continue where i left off on a couch but i am suffering from performance visually awesome but make the game playable for oldee mobile
3,this is seriously a good game for me i can get distracted easily since there are lots of other things to do than the main quest the characters are loveable and the scenery are spectacular have not gotten any lag spikes and i get to lower the resolution or heighten the resolution to whatever i want controlling the characters and fighting monsters is quite smooth the weapon banner pity system does not transfer and the anniversary sucks a lot sometimes i wonder if mihoyo is really listenin
3,say what you want about the gacha system or the botw like aesthetic this game is well put together and has a deep running lore with beautifully crafted environments and unique characters however after almost two years next to nothing has changed when it comes to character variety still using the same bases they lack variety please add new rigs and body types
3,do not like it very much played it on console and it is full of bad design choices the menu being the same button as climbing paimon speaking in third person linear combat every chest having exclusively pocket watches poor controls paimon speaking in third person the map is tiny but there is still tiwers you need to find to unlock the regions feels very much like breat of the wild they took all the surface things like discovering towers ro unlock regions and put them in their game
3,its a beautiful game but the lowest graphical settings can still be too much for mid tier phones making it unplayable is most combat situations i have noticed that there is a lot of foliage grass model detail and poly count seem to be completely unchanged based on high or low settings meaning that majority of the models are unoptimized if the game is optimized this way and perhaps more on different areas it would increase the play count in the mobile user area
3,this game is absolutely amazing incredible graphics an amazing storyline and interesting characters however my phone can no longer hold the game the amount of storage this takes is ridiculous and i am going to have to uninstall because i would like to have other apps on my phone if you really enjoy genshin impact it is ultimately better to play on a different device it runs very smoothly and storage is not a problem when i play on pc
3,the gameplay story graphics soundtrack and animations are all absolutely amazing the open world is perfect and the quests are engaging the characters are all unique and well created voiced only reason for three stars is the game makes my phone hot enough to fry an egg and it drains my battery faster than it can charge if i play while plugged in severely limiting my play time some optimization improvements and it would certainly be deserving of five stars
3,good game overall but lacking in a few areas mainly for me the controls do not always feel responsive both touch screen and ps and the camera can be quite poor especially in combat also as with any gacha the rates are awefull which is fine normally except you need certain elements for effective combat and puzles so bad pulls can really hold you back in this game on a side note for the new glider event it is terrible poor camera unclear courses and jerky controls
3,great graphics music and sound however the gatcha system and earning system in order to summon units is not good getting new units is shared with getting weapons so you cannot summon a character without summoning weapons you also need duplicate characters in order to unlock more passive abilities getting primo or currency for wishing summons can get a bit tedious but the main and biggest problem i have right now is the connection lag starting and logging into the game takes minute
3,i play of the time on pc but use the android version when i travel this app runs poorly on my two year old mid range phone but it is to be expected i am honestly impressed it runs at all and that is thanks to the many graphical options my only complaint is that hoyoverse does not support controller input on android despite supporting it on ios since early more than anything i find the touch controls make the gameplay feel awful hoyoverse could and should offer a better experience
3,the game is really fun very entertaining but i have some concerns i do not know if it is just me but when i first downloaded the game the quality was perfection but now it is very blurry and blunt and the sound crashes a lot which makes me suddenly get out of the game and the storage is a huge problem after the update my phone just could not take it so i had to uninstall but it does run very nicely on my pc or ipad without any problems
3,to big of a game on mobile its like six gigabyte for me it takes up alot of storage on my phone otherwise this game would be a four
3,i  really love this game but why icannot log in after the update using my facebook account how can i fix it
3,it was really slow to download everything but overall seems like a great game
3,this game is very fun and i enjoyed it for a while but after a while it just got boring i do not know if this is just me
3,this game is quite good on lore one problem why is the download so slow i use a phone i have good internet connection
3,love the game but getting wishes is so hard the events give you little primo so does the quests
3,great game but i freaking hate farming for handguards and fungi
3,main story getting boring world quest are more interesting and better though it not voice
3,i played this on my phone but it will not let me login my tablet for some reason it cannot let me play rn but i would recommend to play
3,the game will not let me remap the buttons for touchscreen
3,it fun but the updates take up too much space and i cannot play anymore
3,i cannot get into the game because it keeps on saying that it has insufficient storage space but it does not
3,game is cool but need something like vehicle to travel fast travel is boring
3,il change my review later but the download is too much wow i mean i lost interest in playing this i will change my review later brb
3,it is so hard to win and all of my wishes are always hard pity
3,i minute playing this game almost years rewards sucks and you given rewards for new players it is not fair you want old players quit game
3,when we update it or when we first download it it takes to long to load but it is a nice game after all
3,game is fantastic but game is not fully launch means story and game size is thirty gigabyte plus very high for normal mobile user
3,in my samsung a fifty four five giga why playstation controller did not detect i want to play using controller let the andriod player using controller in this game it is hard to program controller support my god
3,great game but needs better end game content to put our team building and characters to the test
3,it was a great game when first released but now just bored too bad they cannot keep it up
3,great game but the storylines are a bit basic aint it i cannot see my damagee
3,genshin please fix your game cause it keeps crashing for me i will rate this a five star if you fixed it
3,if you are expecting rewards do not play it the characters are good and the gameplay is fun but the devs are so obviously greedy they barely give anything for their anniversary and this is made worse by the ridiculous gacha system not to mention the game frequently develops bugs that they are slow in patching there was an incident where a hacker was able to delete people out of their game that terrified loads of players that they took far too long to patch
3,the game we all wanted genshin impact you need to play this game as it is a open world exploration fights characters etc the characters look so cool and their voices are awesome the only improvement is about the battles and also sometimes when i open it it takes me to a black screen and closes the game and i am not able to play for so long time until if fixes please fix this glitch
3,i have been playing since one point zero adventure rank sixty and with the release of star rail the feeling of not being heard by the developers get stronger the multiple changes we keep asking for can be found in star rail while genshin still does not have them more resins endgames substats change etc and the lack of communication from the developers is concerning the difficulty of the abyss open world is not balanced compared to the rewards received the story and the graphics are wonderful but that is it
3,hello i recently started playing genshin impact again i love the architectural visual styles a lot the buildings and the world is very beutiful however i do have some wishes for the game for it to truly be amazing in my opinion i would like to see more characters with varied skin tones there is not a lot of that which kind of sucks but i also think it would be cool to have a character like a playable hillichurl some more out there character designs and ideas it would add some needed variation
3,i have been playing for almost a year now one year next week i think and i love the game i have been able to bond with people from my new school because of it gameplay story and characters are so amazing although this only gets and it is because ever since january my game has been crashing alot i cannot go ten minutes without it crashing this has happened before when i first started but after a month or two it want away but it all of a sudden came back
3,i love and enjoyed this since it was launched however the only problem i have is the stuttering graphics especially on cutscenes as much as i enjoyed playing i have since stopped because each update means more memory space and i have changed four phones with high end spec features and still have trouble with the graphics sad to say overbloated variations is what will be your downfall just saying thanks
3,great game but i do not like how there is so much going on there are several missions several characters several character missions way too many spots on the map which is good if you like sandbox games and it takes up way too much storage do not get me wrong it is super fun it is exactly breath of the wild but i do not know if i want to play genshin impact anymore because every time i think of it i feel overwhelmed be prepared for a long cutscene at the beginning requires internet
3,the art style quests characters lore storyline and everything is truly exceptional but i had to stop playing because of how bigger the size of the app gets every update it would be better if somehow we can delete the files or resources of the previous quests that we have finished and will not need but overall it is a great game
3,it took about hours until i could play the game most of it being the downloading files stuff but the other was issues with the opening cutscene the sound was glitchy and the screen was all white i had no trouble choosing one of the twins but after that i had the same problem for the rest of the cutscene i got out of the game and went back in and the second one was fine the gameplay is pretty good and i love the graphics
3,ok i absolutely adore this game everything from the designs to the world building except for the fact that i do not get to experience the full extent of the designs my issues with the game have persisted ever since i started playing firstly no damage numbers are visible on screen secondly whenever the water is frozen using cryo i cannot see the frozen portion whatsoever thirdly whenever i am close to a water body it starts glowing uncontrollably and nothing is visible i hope it is fixed soon
3,it truly is an amazing game with a beautiful art style and has voice feature so you do not have to read i think though i put stars because it already took up twenty gigabyte storage and will continue to take up more it takes a lot of space and getting five star items or characters are too rare and it is a little overpriced but in general the game is free and i really recommend it if you have a lot of storage and free time i was logged out of my account and when i logged back in i started again
3,this game is great the gameplay is excellent and if your phone cannot handle it you can change the graphics settings however it consumes a lot of storage space and it is extremely difficult to obtain your favorite characters without spending hours on quest and farming for chest furthermore unlike ios an android phone like mine cannot use controllers i need to spend five minutes getting honest feedback so please fix the problem i encountered and i would like to learn more about the game
3,i have this downloaded on my laptop and it has smooth graphics and the game is good the thing only thing is some maps triggered one of my phobiasthalassophobia it also made me have anxiety alot of times it would be better if the events were easier because sometimes it is very stressing overall the game is good but i just hope it will not happen again
3,this is so slow changing characters is slow running is slow the glide takes you straight down instead of letting you fly i love the art the effects and things to do but mann it is so slow there is so much space to drive around but no vehicles i love that i can skip but i live the fast life is there a character that is built for speed i cannot wait to explore more and see what else there is though
3,definitely one of the games i played for a long time however the more you play the game the more you realize how the games content is actually not that many some might argue that this is false because there is so many nations locations before i would have agreed but after playing this game for more than a year i disagree my reasoning for it is because exploring teyvat is not that hard teyvat is very easy to explore the map is also really easy to understand which makes exploring really easy other than that the characters are all designed well reward system is very flawed in my opinion it takes a long time to actually get primo game currency once you are an end game player which would sometimes brainwash you into pretty much acting as if the daily commission is a chore story lore wise however is really good i love the lore and it is very engaging events in game is sometimes it is extremely uninteresting and sometimes it is really engaging so it just depends on your personal tastes
3,beautiful game beautiful music i would not recommend if you are not prepared to grind do not expect to get characters unless you grind and save for at least full updates or spend money artifact system desperately needs to change many characters are in need of reworks and or buffs i am hoping they will eventually do something about this but i doubt it will change after a certain level playing often feels like a chore and can lose almost all enjoyability
3,i have been playing this game since six and the gameplay graphics world building and the characters are all great however this recent update has been less pleasant since the game would often crash at first i thought the problem is my device but after hearing from my friends that they also experienced the same thing i hope the devs would fix this soon it really discouraged me to go back at the loading screen again
3,the game is fun and all the plot is really good but overtime the app crashing is becoming over bearing ever since i downloaded this the app keeps crashing and sometimes i have to repeat my quest because of it and when kaeya freezes the water i cannot seem to see the ice bridge which makes it very difficult for me to walk on water i also cannot see the damages my characters does how would i know my progress if i do not see it maybe when this is fixed i will give it a full five star
3,it is a great game really fun even without paying for wishes only two complaints it can seriously be a grind when trying to get the right components to level up your characters but it is purposely designed that way the game is not compatible with game controllers so you have to use the touch screen system do not understand why the company does not like android phones
3,beautiful game absolutely stunning slightly laggy the only reason i gave a three star review is because of the loading time it took me five hours to get into the game play but eventually the loading stops and it was great but then my screen went black and i could not do anything and the music was breaking please fix this and i most likely will set the review at five stars
3,i play in a computer a windows ten and it is super laggy when ever i want to join a cooperative it takes forever to load like every ten seconds in the loading screen it says genshin impact is not responding i do not know if my computer is the problem but just fix this so i would not have to wait minutes in the loading screen but overall the game has good lore thanks hoyoverse
3,i loved the game utmost it gives me the real anime experience all beautiful sceneries which are well designed but the problem is that the device heats a lot even the newest one plus nine heats high battery drain it would be better if you create this game well optimised other things i have no issues everything was perfect
3,s ultra restart fixed the issue with crashing this is a great game overall but it needs refinement it is not mature in terms of well thought mechanics and systems its greedy in a sense because it forces you to invest way too much time and or money for so little return whether it be resources materials or properly animated or entertaining stories it is also pretty bad for new players since you miss out on so many events and weapons still fun overall and beautiful design
3,every single time i decided to fight a weekly boss it goes perfectly fine the grind is great and the rewards are gud except when i am fighting childe for so damn reason every single time i fought him to get the weekly rewards and every single tike it gets to his final form the game decides that its a great idea to leave me on a screen where i can see the boss but i cannot do anything i cannot move cannot attack cannot heal cannot go into the inventory cannot even quit the game please fix
3,i have been playing this game for almost year and the game is really fun it has great graphics nice gameplay great story plot and the character designs are wonderful but the rewards are lacking for challenges and events that needed so much effort very little rewards are given which is why i gave it stars i just hope this changes in the future
3,i love genshin impact but i play on the playstation compared to that the mobile version is abysmal the controls especially are terrible i would be nice if i could sync my playstation controller with it also i put the graphics on the lowest settings and my phone still overheats after a few hours despite all that i appreciate the cross play so i can keep up with dailies and events while i am not home
3,i really like this game i love the characters voice acting graphics everything except the storage as of right now it takes up nine gigabyte and it took four gigabyte for this new update four gigabyte to pre install and to actually get the update and for some reason if i switch my game to a different language i cannot delete the old one i had honestly the game has beautiful graphics and a wide open world but it really should get some downsize in storage soon i will have to stop playing because of this
3,the graphics and different characters are amazing every character and quest are unique this is one of the games you can free play and spend hours on i am addicted to this game edit one thing i would change is the fact that you need such a good ping to play even when you are on single player mode i can barely play now because i keep getting teleported to the beginning of a quest
3,the game is really nice but there are some aspects that i do not like first of all although there is only game and applications on my phone it freezes excessively when opening wish and six levels to play with friends it is ridiculous to be i get a lot of muscle while walking or something please fix them i call it freezing i cannot walk etc other than that the characters are great but even though i have few characters no characters appear i think i will increase my chances
3,the prices could be adapted to each country reality in brazil the prices are really high in comparison to other countries like usa it needs more attention so we can have a fairer game experience by the way i love the game i feel inspired by the design and the world it helps me to feel good when i am in a bad mood i love so much the characters i feel connect with them and with their stories the gameplay is very fun
3,gameplay is good and the quests are great but the game is truly amazing if you have a phone that has larger storage and is more suited for games that take up battery the game should be able to function much better and not lag so much when you are on low graphics and have a bad ping signal overall the game is great but it would be nice if the game were smoother when a player is using low graphics than when it is on a higher graphic setting to save battery and the amount of lag that happens
3,great game over all with an engaging storyline and cool characters even if you do not purchase premium items and units the game is not unplayable yet i am not too far in and that could change however from a technical standpoint i have been having trouble running the app since the latest update at first it was just some stuttering frames at times but now just going into a menu is enough to crash the app entirely it was running fine a week ago but not anymore
3,pretty good game overall the gameplay is fun the graphics are beautiful and the music is amazing it is also the only open world gacha game and has a huge map to explore however it is unfortunately run by a company who does not care about it is community at all their refusal to properly address player concerns and fix issues that have existed since launch makes the user experience extremely frustrating
3,game starts as rather fun but the longer you play the more design and gameplay flaws you encounter overall experience can be summarized as following pros fun to explore world with various puzles decent story regular various events note due to the big differences in event gameplay mechanics some may be to your liking and some may not but considering overall variety it will still be a positive thing four smooth combat albeit lacking some necessary user interface elements cons daily routine becomes too repetitive and boring after finishing world exploration character progression is horrible with excessive rng elements where it should not be in the first place looking at you artifact domains developers feedback is lacking and issues that have been bothering players since day are still unaddressed conclusion overall it may be ok to try this game for a bit just do not expect much in the long term
3,genshin is probably the most beautiful game you can play at the moment the univers is simply stunning the animations are great though i wish they could be skipped after they have been seen once like old school rpgs this is one of the points where mihoyo fails to draw from its predecesors the characters are generally well thought out and fun to discover where things get hard is once you actually play the game the controls are absolutely horrible and controller support is nowhere in sight ios has had this for nearly a year now but some of the workarounds people have come up with on android have led to users being banned leaving you to contend with very underwhelming touchscreen controls you will also find yourself fighting the engine much more than the enemies there are a number of ways the game becomes anti immersive from the constant zooming in depending on your combat actions there should simply be a way to turn off auto zoom off but this illudes the devs completely to enemies walking off a preset area mid fight where they will walk back to their spawn point and regen one hundred percent hp and have you start the fight over something to drive you insane when fighting new and more powerfull foes all in all the game is good but some basic improvements would make it much more enjoyable
3,disappointing i have a relatively nice phone but this game lags like hell and heats up my phone real fast it is hard to use the controls on a phone too also the game is fun but its so annoying to have to level up several levels to get to the next story quest i wish there was more help in game to help you learn combat skills and creating strong characters the story is definitely interesting its just such a hassle to play
3,its a fantastic game very good on battles and story but it is lacking alot of things for starters there are cut scenes that need to be fixed in terms of when characters come into play second the graphics are quite splotchy and does not look as nice when you get close it may also help to make it better for far less optimized devices edited
3,i love this game so much but the controls on mobile are really difficult they take up a large portion of the screen so i hit things accidentally die because of it or lose animals it is the only frustrating part but impacts gameplay significantly so that is why i have it stars the rest of the game is amazing and beautiful the story is engaging and i absolutely love it and cannot wait for it to come out on switch wish this would release to xbox
3,this game is amazing ever since i started playing it i am super invested in the storyline and the characters since the beginning but one thing i have a problem is the resin system the resin refill is the one i dislike so much the problem is that it takes too long to refill and also the cost on using it for leyline and domains and it is also so quick to be out and gone other than that the game overall is awesome
3,firstly you would want a phone with gigabyte or more to play this it will take eight gigabyte to install and will increase in the future the game is exceptionally well made for a phone game except for lip syncing which is atrocious the monetization is very heavy handed with almost every scheme in display gacha battle pass xp etc while it is possible to finish the game without spending money the mtx makes your life a heck of a lot easier with less grinding
3,the game got a lot better some bugs are fixed i hope they keep up the great work i also hope server lag issues get fixed because as a mobile player there were some instances wherw the pick up option or button does not appear quickly letting some valuable resources go away crystal fly cores and sometimes the mobs does not drop anything or if they do the drops are far from where it died or sometimes it does not give anything at all i hope these issues get fixed and give us more primo please
3,really addictive game amazing storyline and fun gameplay though i have one thing that troubles me a lot that is the game disconnecting too often whenever i am in a battle in the spiral abyss and it disconnects it resets the battle and i have to start over again same thing with fighting bosses i would have gave it five stars if it were not to disconnect a lot i would be satisfied if this issue is fixed
3,this game is so great i love it and all but i have an issue regarding whenever i play it crashes a lot even though my gameplay is fine and there is nothing wrong with my ping or anything whenever i am in cooperative with friends it would be hard to play with them since the game keeps crashing in the past i shrugged it off since i believed they would fix the crashing sooner but till now it has not
3,this game is phenomenal the story and characters are a little lackluster but it does not take away from the intense fun the world is full of stuff todo and explore but there is something that is also part of the playstation port the performance is the worst i am playing on a galaxy eight which should be capable but unfortunately not the playstation as well on my pc though it runs smoothly and looks awesome i guess they just went overboard on the graphics with this game
3,i really had fun playing this game despite having a freezing cutscenes the issue is that stormterror and signoriai forget the name have texture glitches please i beg you please fix it it is so hard to fight the bosses alone and the texture glitches makes it almost impossible i hope you will consider this issue most of us are experiencing it so i hope you will fix it i am really looking forward to it thank you for creating this game
3,i wish i could report my issues but the cs button is inconveniently in game before i went on a break the game worked perfectly but after i came back and had to update it gets stuck on the white elements loading screen and rarely ever loads then it suddenly crashed out of nowhere in the middle of a battle i really want to keep playing genshin again these bugs are making it impossible for me to even play the game anymore reinstalling is not helping neither is reverifying the files
3,the game is very good but the missing controller support on android is a no go for a game like this the touch control is not that bad but the combat system need a controller for the whole fun if you add a native controller support for android i will change to five stars i did not have any lags the graphics are very nice the game runs smooth played on oneplus seven pro partially with highest or middle graphics to play longer with battery
3,amazing game gripping story and well written characters with fantastic music as well the only issue at the moment is that the system requirements which are way too high given that only a small amount of mobile players actually have premium phones that can run this game smoothly it is really annoying everytime you get to a stormterror cutscene or fight you cannot see anything and you will end up exhausting all your items trying to stay alive but failing anyway please optimize your game better
3,it is a big game takes up a lot of room on the device one i got into the game i could see why it is truly an immersive world you can explore all of it i enjoyed the stories and graphics the dungeons seem shallow they are over very quickly like most mobile games i would continue playing but it stopped working the loading screen with the seven symbols used as a progress bar always freezes there i tried the repair feature it says all files are fine due to size i do not want redownload
3,do not get me wrong i love this game and used to be obsessed with it but now i cannot even play it due to it crashing everytime i start it my phone is absolutely fine so i cannot point it onto that i can barely get past the loading screen and when i do it crashes as soon as everything starts loading the one time i have gotten it to get past these screens was when i restarted the app at least five times and then it crashed as soon as i teleported please fix this issue i want to play again
3,fantastic and beautiful however keeps crashing i do not know what to do i have cleared the cache and data i have looked online to find a fix and i cannot make it right i load the game and anywhere between twenty seconds and a few minutes the game crashes every single time was not like this before the update and now it is so frustrating i want to delete the game minus the crashing it is a really fun and relaxing game to play
3,the game is great however after the latest update i cannot get in to play i get to the screen where it says tap to start but then the loading screen after just crashes or freezes i have tried uninstalling and reinstalling verifying my files contacting customer support and even deleting my older apps but noting it works just fine on my pc however i hope that this issue is fixed soon
3,i loved playing this game but after the most recent update it has become impossible i am rarely able to open the game without it crashing the majority of times i am able to open the game it immediately freezes or the first time i teleport the game freezes i am so disappointed because i would made so much progress i have verified file integrity numerous times i have never had issues like this before i am not using an older phone i am playing on an note twenty i wish the issue would be rectified
3,this is a very good game i just have two problems it keeps freezing my phone after ten minutes of gameplay and it is really annoying having to boot it back up after five minutes and the second problem it takes up so much space i constantly have to delete apps to make space for a new update and it never gets any better otherwise i love it but at least make it a bit easier to get new characters i hope you can fix these problems a very excited yet disappointed fan
3,pretty great game visually and functionally android pixela i have some heating issues and aim mode is terrible because of it with archers aside from that it slows down sometimes in certain areas but not often it closes once the screen switches so do not expect it it run in the background if you want to answer a call or send a whatsapp message
3,so i have only been playing since this month and overall it is fun and cannot put it down however like many on here the lag kills me i do not have a computer and my good tablet is being repaired so all i have is my phone i will be flying and then my game freezes then my character dies out of nowhere and i have to start over same for when battling especially bosses hopefully can get some improvements that are geared towards phone users
3,overall the game is very fun lots to do looking forward to new areas and quests in the future one major complaint i have is about the lack of controller support on mobile i play almost exclusively on pc because of the controller support why cannot mobile users get the same i would love play more on my phone but the game is incredibly difficult to play comfortably with just onscreen controls
3,sound comes through with static making it hard to enjoy the music controls are okay for touch controls but not great touch controls on an action game never will be despite having a huge phone screen my thumbs take up too much of the screen action games on mobile should come with controller support i just cannot play anymore hands cramp up after less than an hour of gameplay i would sink tons of hours and money just add controller support it would be better for me if you would just add it to xbox
3,amazing game however the controls the lack of control support and inability to customize the combat buttons are very frustrating the buttons are too close together and i often find myself pressing the wrong buttons in bad situations the game itself is amazing work but proper controller dualshock xbox etc support also instead of the directional buttons functioning like a traditional pad it should work like an analog stick with slide to move rather than press it makes it easier to move
3,initially i was hooked to this game i usually do not play any games rather then puzle games but this was an immediate exception after first few days it started to lag i still enjoyed it but then suddenly in one of the recent updates the game become so huge in size that my device could not update it with it is limited storage so i uninstalled and tried to reinstall still it says unable to download it is an awesome game but developers must think about data compression thank you
3,mihoyos third venture is certainly ambitious and genshin impact is definitely on the high end of quality the gacha system while enticing is optional for anything except the hardest of challenges the game world is very pretty to look at and the combat has some clever tricks to encourage wild experimentation unfortunately the controls do not follow through precision issues and an overloaded user interface makes the mobile version a hard sell optimally play on pc touch controls just do not cut it
3,i cannot get past the bridge loading screen it says there is a error called error code forty and i cannot fix it no matter what i do i have tried closing and re opening the game turning my internet connection on and off and even deleting and re installing it nothing will work i am pretty sure its not my internet connection because everything else works perfectly fine my friend told me to download this game and that it is really good so that is why i gave it stars i jist need help fixing this bug ty
3,first time i downloaded this everything was working perfectly however after the latest update i have been experiencing so many bugs example sometimes the commissions locations do not appear in my map when i enlarge it so i could navigate there were also times when i play cooperative the other persons character just glitches through the screen hoping for a better experience in the next update
3,the game is really good but please make it a mobile friendly game we know that this was originally a pc game but the mobile app heats up the phone when playing the graphics is good but with so much happening during challenges tasks and fights the game frames eventually lag even if it was already put on a lowest graphic settings one of the reasons why you have to restart the app another thing during the story telling part the screen sometimes froze hope you can acknowledge this thanks
3,this a good game the graphics and musics are good but there was a problem with my game it would pause which i was okay with however ot started to skip and freeze when the dragon appears in the town i tried everything i could think of and now cannot get pasted the loading screen i cannot keep a game that i cannot play
3,developers really need to add controller support graphically and game play are stellar i really really like this game but i really hate touch controls they cover up the crown and make it hard to see whats going on and there is no way i can remember where on my smooth glass i am supposed to touch for things really really need controller support
3,i have the lg velvet and for some reason the ground is black and patchy everything else is fine i love the game it makes time pass by beautifully especially with the ambient music in the background the fight mechanics are simple so are the flight controls i will be honest i did have to look up some guides and stuff because the game does not exactly give you a step by step guide but its entertaining enough to keep playing even with half assed graphics for some reason please help me out devs
3,i played this in pc the controls are good graphics is great environment is awesome and the interaction between environment is unique the music and sfx are on another level in other words it is very polished in terms of its environment mechanics and other things the only problem is the resin dungeons and bosses consume too much resin the one x and ten x wish is too expensive hope you make it more fair for players
3,great game and has alot of potential the only concern is how hot my phone honor twenty gets while playing i have reduced the graphics and the fps to try to minimise this unfortunately no change so i can only play in short increments which defeats the point of playing if the techs can find a way to put less strain on our devices the five start it would be
3,this game is great amazing visuals and combat system i really like the grind also however the game needs more optimization fixes i have a good phone that can run this game decently however at certain times my game lags like crazy and crashes which is inconvenient because i may be near the end of a boss fight and i lose my progress
3,not bad can tell that the story has awesome content i am disappointed in the range classes in the game i enjoy range classes the need to manually aim at the target is terrible you should consider implementing auto lock on to the targets camera view could be less messy i hope to zoom out from the character more
3,i liked the graphics and the character design however it is very difficult to navigate the game on a mobile phone the way you have to navigate your phone screen in order to see enemies or to complete tasks so you can go on missions makes it hard to enjoy the game definitely a much better experience on the playstation versus a phone so if you have one you would be much better off playing it that way my brother chose that option and it is far more enjoyable since navigation is easier to do
3,the graphics and visuals are astonishing however before the opening players should be given the option to change the graphics setting i was not able to enjoy the opening cg due to massive lag with internet connection working perfectly the controls and gameplay are spot on though having five or more enemies will slow down combat please implement a lower graphics setting so players can enjoy the game to the fullest no matter the platform
3,the game it self is great and the gameplay is not bad at all the game can run to some devices that has at least four gigabyte of ram but there are some issues when i always start running the game like stops constantly and automatically exits which is a big problem for some players that enjoys playing the game i hope the game will soon be updated and optimized for low end phones and devices so that more players can play and enjoy the game
3,it is as everyone say the animation is good and even the voice actors are doing a great job the scenery is absolutely stunning though there is only one thing making me enjoy fully and that is lag the character suddenly freezes and then the game crashes maybe it is just my phone that cannot handle it all though the game still deserves a star from me
3,works very well on my mobile device textures pop in and out of existence at times reconnecting if you have to pop out of the game for a second is very smooth impressive story is very confusing from the start characters do not know each other but talk like they have interacted at least a few times before
3,i am enjoying this game so much but i do have one huge complaint why is there no cotroller support for mobile a fast paced game such as this need something better than on screen touch controls even the touch controls are not very customizable as i would like to be able to change the locations of the joystick and buttons you have controller support for pc and it works great so i would not think it is out of the question to ask for it otherwise great game
3,pretty decent and loaded with content impressive graphics and a good benchmark for device performance no controller support is available and you are not able to adjust the onscreen controls since the control stick is fixed it is hard to maneuver when on narrow platforms or jumps and i have dive bombed so many times trying to move the camera around this makes getting through the tougher timed courses very difficult controller support or control customization is key to an improved review
3,i would say this is the best open world game anyone can ever find on android in twenty twenty neat graphics character details physics and it is something that will just easily keep anyone hooked however i see the ping issues also the game screen freezes on pc and the game is still running in the background i can move character but the screen is frozen after reaching liyue game is quite laggy even in phone have to force stop most of the times need more optimisation for low end devices and bug fix
3,this game runs terribly on my htc ten there should be a hardware check or some form of benchmark before letting you decide if you want to perform the six gigabyte download or not the intro could barely play freezing most of the time and the game looks blurry otherwise from what i have managed to play it looks promising not a fan of onscreen keypads but the controls are pretty well designed making picking up items and controlling the camera easy hopefully better optimised at some point
3,please add the ability to change the game settings from the login screen it is very difficult to switch from pc with high graphics settings to mobile which requires lower graphics settings the game locks up too much on mobile before i can get to the menus in game to change it or add the ability to set the graphics settings for mobile and pc separately other than this great game
3,gave up on playing on my rog phone it runs too hot and the audio lacks bass disabling the audio makes game run hella better unskippable cutscenes the subs cannot be turned off controls to get gliding too sensitive if lagging i failed the gliding challenges several times because of camera and controls found myself jumping around a lot more than fighting during combat cause the buttons are too close together went to play pc version and am having much better experience than on my phone
3,nice game beautiful graphics lovely open world to explore but the dev team needs to optimize their code a lot more right now it seems to be leaking memory like a sieve leaks water the game runs fine when freshly stated but the frame rate immediately starts dropping noticeably to a point where it is unplayable and requires a restart after as little as half hour
3,great game so far but lacking in options it needs controller support or at least the ability to adjust the location of the controls on screen i have a nine screen and the controls are set for a six nine screen too close to the center to be comfortable also progress from playstation should be carried over to the mobile version since all progress is saved online
3,graphically this game does not go well with the mobile platform the cutscene animation freezes while the audio continues the graphics for the characters are choppy once you begin any movement controls work well and the menus are similar to botw i am sure the story is great but the first five seconds into the game and the cutscene froze it did not catch up to the audio until it is time to choose either the male of female character to play as five gigabyte download size is massive load screens suck
3,the game has amazing graphics and give acting to boot but the amount of glitches that i experienced was unbelievable it could be my internet connection but the entire time the game just glitches out the faces away surrounding keep disappearing and you cannot really see anything but glowing neon grass on the floor i will not say it has to others who like the game but personally it was something i could not okay even if i wanted to i look forward to the upcoming updates
3,this game is so good but ping issue in india ruins the gameplay
3,i fell in love with the games characters and story however has felt stagnant and reptitive for the longest time when other games are coming out with better progression genshin needs to do the follow increase resin add more endgame content add a guild club system for friends and socials a an item to reroll artifacts substats add ways two improve characters without resin add a awakening system to characters by using an item for example if fischl is awakened she can have two birds
3,really a great game to play i like the story characters and like the concept of building characters but there is one problem that i am always having since one two is that whenever i am trying to download the game in my pc it shows an games files verification error i watched everything on youtube to solve the issue but any of the solutions did not work if you guys help me to solve it i would appreciate it
3,spent so much on the game already but my free to play friend always gets the better things wth
3,not a casual game end game is horrible literally no immersion but on the plus side the lore in interesting map is quite big lot of things to do but gets grindy real soon and the grind is not enjoyable the company rarely listens to the players and we end up getting the short end of the stick even after putting money in it not cool
3,graphic and music are absolutely stunning but it is really hard to play without spending a fortune the prizes are small you cannot even choose five even standard after entering to game the pity system especially on weapon banner is bad please hoyoverse do not let your game die because of your avarice
3,yes i love this game but it takes way to much storage on mobile
3,i really love the game so much but for some reason my phone with exynos prossesor it is not optimized well sometimes it lags so much and overheats which is bad for my experience since the rise of snapdragon chipsets cause they are the only one who is optimized please optimize this game for exynos
3,can you let me log in to genshin impact i have managed the storage but it still did not working what should i do
3,the new update it bullshit and the new side quest boss is way to hard might quit this game
3,damn its been three years and still no android controller support quite unfair do not you think well anyway still good game
3,too many downloads i just wanted to quickly play in an old region that i have not completed yet with old characters but the game needs an gigabyte update it would be nice if i could choose which regions expansions i want to download and which i do not and then be restricted from entering those regions or if i could download the new content while playing like how world of warcraft does it on the pc
3,i mean it would be great if the game did not constantly crash and kick me out
3,the gameplay mechanics the storyline is a masterpiece and i would like to play it again like back in my old days because at that time it does not take that much storage but now i cannot even play it anymore eversince sumeru came out and it requires about gigabytes of space in order for me to play it again i hope hoyoverse would reduce the space it needed even more
3,its a fun game and i love it but it really eats a lot of space currently gigabyte please do something about it because it really adds a big bad impact on the game and i believe most of the player whove left the game is because of the storage problems please do something bout it and the game you made is really amazing
3,good story decent gameplay do not reccomend playing on mobile it does play fairly well though i only play at the lowest graphic settings if possible i reccomend playing on pc or playstation instead because the experience is much better in my opinion edit after the four two update genshin has literally become unplayable if you have bad internet connection or an older phone with less space do not even waste your time trying to download this
3,it is fine but walls in fontaine do not load and it is hard to play like that
3,super but i cannot handle genshin enymore because ot the space requirements also the geforce now do not support my region
3,predatory gacha good great gameplay and pretty great story six ten
3,hello it is a good game but unfortunately the stages have many explanations and i get bored
3,not good not bad probably a copy of legend of zelda female characters stories somehow have bunch of problems compare to male characters whos much better in terms of story writing the artifacts luck is so bad diversity or race shown in the game is not executed well but liyue characters are good do try to learn more about other cultures for your characters and do better with your writing with female players please
3,how many times does it get updated this is getting annoyed man
3,the game is really good its just that there is too much storage which my phone cannot handle hopefully you can minimize the storage space but over all its really good many places the explore characters details are really unique hopefully you find this review helpful
3,there is no arabic translation while it already has so many arabic players it is hard to understand the lore and the long dialogue as the whole game depends on it
3,the graphics are too bad for samsung a did it i was very dissaponted actually
3,can you guys fix the optimization on poco f giga my fps dropped but in other games such as honkai star rail i am not lag
3,not gamepad compatible on android i hate covering part of the screen with my fingers that is why i bought one of those controllers that make my phone look like a portable console but then the most popular rpg on mobile has no compatibility it is only compatible on iphones the game is good but i cannot give it five stars for this blunder
3,great game but is a time consuming one and a painful one when you not get good stats and sub stats on artifacts they should change artifact system a little its been months since i have been doing desert pavilion domain for scara and have got only two good once only
3,i like the game and everything but i did not receive the mail that you hoyovers sent to the players for the issue with wriothesley i am sure of it and i contacted you in gmail too like three days ago and i re sended another one just now so i hope that you help me
3,make a lite version would be a good idea i have friends that i used to play with since week of genshin released but now most of them cannot play it due to framedrop etc the cloud version are also nice but the time limit is just not enough to do other stuff mostly just do daily coms not enough time to do story or events
3,based on others opinion the game overall is good but the problem is the game system which makes most of the mobile user in disadvantage because of how the game can suddenly stopped or glitched so if anything fix the problem so that any mobile user can enjoy w o any trouble
3,game really good and beautiful and played since launch but i stop playing a year ago and nowi am trying to catch back up but its being a bit annoying when you cannot skip dialogue conversation or cutscenes you not interested in if they can add that i will truly return
3,old characters need buffs and model update treasure compass gadget indicator arrow effect should be clearer and should last longer oculi collection should be made easier so one would rely on in game map not ecternal or out of game map after collecting a certain amount on toggle they should all appear on minimap
3,only three stars because there are missions that are hard to find just like my mission haysz
3,i would have give it a five please fix the login some reason kept saying fail to log in
3,the game is honestly amazing and i have quite enjoyed playing it for the last three years but i am giving it one star for not giving us a free star standard character after all these years like i legit cannot accept that for more than three whole years i have not gotten a single diluc which was my first ever wanted character since one but i instead i legit now have constellationmona and constellationjean and constellationtighnari and constellationqiqi and constellationkeqing i even have constellationdehya but that is only because i got her when she was limited
3,good game but it needs controller support for android
3,a quite good game but please better the ping of the game on asia server it is no fun playing at ping
3,great game waiting for android controller support to really get attached the touch controls are not bad though beautiful scenery fantastic combat and an open world that is a pleasure to explore came back to update in still no controller support stopped playing all together waiting for it tower of fantasy is a better option ifyou are looking for the console experience update still no controller support i have all but forgotten this game still holding out
3,nice game but no new endgame and rewards not really satisfying and i have no hope for future genshin
3,it really need the costom key leyout because every time i try to move my camera i hit attack or skill botton
3,audio is not working even i tried to do a lot of ways to bring back my audio but nothings happen please fix this
3,wish it could be playable with a controller hooked up to my phone or tablet
3,game is all good but game developer should rename worshipping statue of seven option
3,the game is good but the problem is the storage i delete apps photos and videos and need more storage and i am using mobile too so i will give this a three
3,please add controller support thank you
3,i want good artifacts i have bad luck on everything i need a better artifacts
3,i think this game is such an enjoyable game that i played for the past two years but a while ago i decided to uninstall it and then last thursday i decided to download it at my pc but it took so long to the point it took four days but until now it still does not download and every time it went to it go back to which is really annoying it makes me impatient and annoyed it is already monday and i still cannot play the game because of this my internet is very stable and my pc do not haveproblem
3,i think a creaters wants to put a game size increase by the all in games update and do not put any update after game download thts you know why bcs a update size is around a gigabyte so that is why we want to a always turn on our sreec for update that is why our phone get a so heat and it is chance to lose your phone when updating that is why i am asking
3,i was disappointed the skills and kits design on dehya and things the marketing team did to her was terrible as well they just showed us how incredibly bad the communication inside the development team by team yet they do not listen the request to buff her great job edited after four update the fontaine hydro region is good though
3,will not download all the way just half and stop then crash i play this game on chrome book befor
3,game itself is not that bad it just prioritizes story over gameplay making it boring the longer you play it everything else is polished and i could at least say that the graphics design is great just something to keep in mind is the awful optimization
3,lack of support for a controller really hurts playability
3,here five because i can i am gacha addict but not poor so please continue your work also please add prop hunt permanently i love play prop hunt win leave repeat
3,its fun and all but takes up too much space
3,it is good but the updates are making it hard to play i mean thus update makes me download gigabyte and that is half of my phones storage right there
3,i honestly cannot even play the game it says i not have enough data even though i have more then enough
3,the best rpg game i have ever played love the scenery fighting characters and storyline i used to play it all the time when i had more games on my mobile i just cannot enjoy the storyline quests because you need to level up your adventure rank to get to the nextquest my rank is and for the next quest i need to berank leveling up is hard as world quests do not give any xp and commission quests give less xp please change this this is the major reason why i deleted this game
3,the take to much space the game is not even that fun so what the fcuk i had to to do so much just to get space for this one game
3,it is great and all but it is taking so goddamm long to download
3,hi dev i want to suggest to put controller support on android that be so much better
3,so when i go on my account to play it will freeze my screen on my phone so might need to fix that
3,the game keep crashing and the building in fontaine are glitching most of the building parts and even land glitches and vanish
3,it is wonderful but due to the new update for some reason my genshin will not load in due to no internet connection even though i do have internet connection
3,good game but the graphics for phone is to laggy and if you put max on everything it will lag like super hard and you will not be able to play properly so please lower the fps needed for phones but all in all its a very good game
3,although love this game a lot for it is stories but the rewards are bad as usual and there is not much for android users like me and there should be an addition of controller support for android
3,see it is a very good game but consumes too much time and it is taking ages to get five star character
3,has pay wall music and art is amazing
3,first time i play this i feel this will be the good game it was a good game but after almost three years i have been play this game i feel bored because the story line if i can skip the story i would be amazing
3,was great until this patch made it too big for the phones and ipads of most people i know side note do not you have to be able to log in to unload those files cannot even launch the game to update it without cleaning out the phone
3,too much dialogue and the storytelling stuff is based on words rather than actions
3,free to play friendly however main character male and wings graphic need to be upgraded main male character too girly and ugly and wings need to make it more dreamy please take my advice seriously they are real need to be upgraded instead of focus on new story
3,the features that star rail has really show just how much genshin could improve in many aspects if only that was a priority for them genshin on its own has still made okay strides but there is still a lot of room to improve
3,okay so the only reason i did not give the two stars is because of the storage andi am not able to play genshin in my pc because it is lagging and crashing every time it is quite hard for mobile players so i hope that there is some solution for mobile players without worrying about storage space
3,over all great game and the biggest thing its on mobile phones but i and other players have some issues like its been three years since this game came out and you guys still have not updated anything like you could have made the combat like punishing gray raven or wuthering waves add boats add horses and most important do not ruin the characters like alhaitham you ruined him and wriothesley it seems like he do not have any power but his gloves its cartoonish and please give skip button to skip talks fix
3,the only thing i dislike in this game is the artifacts system it is just way too painful whenever farming for artifacts luck based why not skill based
3,although i have not played this game but i watched videos but the biggest problem is that its downloading for two days and i have not played it please make the downloading software faster
3,how do you guys keep introducing new update sizes upto gigabyte for the already exisiting one that is consume more than of our mobile storage you guys should seriously work on the mobile storage for this game and make it mobile storage friendly this is a mobile game and not just a pc game
3,please optimize this games for android devices the frame drops is ruining the game but on the brighter side the story line quests events are fun
3,game is lacking unique charactes which in my opinion would make that game alot more interesting since of all characters are just sword spear bow yknow these character do not really give me that creativity feel from the game but four one is coming out with another catalyst puncher it would be nice if they add more unique charactersi am perma leaving if the girl with the gun does not have somekind of long range mode and gets ammo from melee or something
3,the game takes a lot of storage to the point where i think there should be a optamization update to reduce or a minimal resourse pack like most games do now
3,with the new update i was not able to play my account again because whenever i tried to go back to the game it crashes and creashes all over again
3,beautiful game but there are additions that i hope will be added for example the arabic language increase daily mission rewards at least primo i think this is what i am asking so please think about it
3,i cannot login to the game via facebook account all my data is in there tried all methods still not working
3,i love this game buti am now looking for more cultural content world culture a game that is world wide should include black people but i know it does not have to just looking at content as a whole it looks racist
3,please fix this game it kicking me out because i have bad internet connection but in every other online apps i have my internet works fast and perfectly fine
3,it is beautiful great characters and gameplay unfortunate how much money is spent when playing thoughi am literally begging you guys to bring it to nintendo switch i do not have anything else to play this on without it crashing my phone
3,the issue is that the game is good but the dev team just does not care about its players noi am not talking about freebies or rewardsi am talking about quality of life if you can think of a qol feature in another gacha odds are that is not in genshin you do not even have to look far hoyoverse has two other games that actively listen to players and implement qol that players ask for not here it almost feels at times that the genshin team actively ignores it is players
3,i used to play it but it became repetitive eventually the game would not progress because it got in a loading screen and after that it would not let me log on it is a good game just it has very annoying bugs
3,graphics are great i really liked the storyline and everything but my game reset completely and i lost all my progressi am back to very start
3,it is a nice game collecting characters weapons and adventures i only give three star to genshin impact because i think honkai star rail has a lot of free wishes instead of genshin giving us stressed out hear me out honkai you needed to give us free primo just this once is stressing out with the same character every year feel bad for the unlucky hawt people me
3,the game is pretty good but the gyro is kinda acting weird it is ok when going up and down but kinda clunky when moving left and right hope you fix this issue
3,it is a good game in the graphic side the battle system is good but it does not support using a controller instead of touch controls it only supports it in ios so that is two stars less because user unfriendliness if i cannot control my character easily then the battle system is less enjoyable in mobile so i prefer the pc version
3,please optimize the game for android devices i cannot play the game on fps without boiling my phone even thoughi am using snapdragon eight gen one also it would be nice if you add mouse and key board options for the game it is frustrating
3,i love the storyline and the characters in the game but i have one problem in the log in i wanted to log in with my google account but i cannot i can only use facebook i hope the developers sees this because my google genshin account are my most invested account so far i hope this option exists in the future
3,just got a backbone for my phone and did not realize that this game does not support controllers on android other than that i have heard good things keep up the good work guys
3,overall i have seen videos on their youtube channel and it draws me to the game and i love all the character demos but as a mobile player i have this on my tablet for like a month now because my tablet cannot let sd cards move apps so i cannot get enough storage so i suggest you make an app that lets you download all genshin assets on and updates pleasei am begging you i really wanna play
3,everything is good and great but only problem is the ping issue in asia server ping is never good it is always in between ms sometimes it even goes around ms it is really annoying please fix this issue
3,great until it is not the app gets so big that it is insufficient storage i deleted it at gigabyte that is insane
3,fontaine new area update very nice story quest well written and diving mechanic is enjoyable lacks on qol and prone to fomo qol requested many times like resin increase artifact load out and such less generous to players as well learn from hsr
3,same boring heavy story focused game since day one but newly added soy boy card game if you have insomia i recommend to play this game you will sleep in minute of gameplay
3,this game is amazing however the atorage it takes up is huge i can play it on ps but on mobile no way i wiped my whole phone only to find out that i cannot download it either way the game is too big takes up half of my storage
3,good game just do not play on this chromebook model acer chromebook spin it will not run well warning to those who are installing on this chromebook model if you want to play genshin impact on your chromebook use geforce now
3,just started and it is been a pretty decent experience already but i just started when i get more familiar ifi am still having as much fun with the game i will change my review to
3,love the game but ever since fontaine released i have experienced a lot of bugs and crashing when i reach certain areas underwater the screen keeps freezing and i cannot move my phone keeps restarting because of iti am sad to let go of this game for the meantime but i had to uninstall it due to this problem
3,this game massively needs to be optimized gigabyte patches is insane and it is never dense fun stuff it is always pages of meandering dialogue that any editor would know to cut great game other than that but come on polish this thing
3,the game is fun and very beautiful but there is one big problem when you when you try to load the files have to delete some of games i deleted all my games i only have snapchat on my and it is not working
3,its been a while since i have played this game i just wanna say it a really nice game but its just that i have been hacked here and not once have ghey given back my account even though i have proved that i was the original owner hopefully this does not happen to anyone else and hopefully those who have been hacked gets back their account
3,see i bet there is nothing wrong with the actual gamebut i have been trying to install it for about a year now and it just tells me there is not enough space even on brand new phones so beware
3,if you keep update like this i do not think people will be interested anymore to play gigabyte not a joke and you guys up the minimum spec to play this game i do not have problem with spec but the update gigabyte are wild sorry to say hoyoverse your player start to decreased since three seven patch cause of boring event and too heavy update like gigabyte every update
3,this is a pretty fun game but it takes up way to much storage and it makes it harder to play the game they have really good characters and i love the lore
3,i really like this game but it takes a lot of gigabyte in my phone and i do not really want to delete it too i just want that you guys will have an option to remove all cgs if we want less use of space for this game
3,the graphics and events are all really nice but i deleted more than ten apps to play this game but yet the screen just shows that i have insufficient storage space and sometimes the game is really laggy i would appreciate if you could tell me why
3,on the new update for some reson i cannot get to load in it only shows my the wvision screen for loading in but never loads the visions in and it does not work
3,i love this game i am very impressed by how much content they add and the details and designs of all the characters and new areas it just keeps getting better each timei am excited for fontaine
3,optimise the game for mobile players its genuinely ridiculous that it takes up nearly gigabyte of my storage and it lags like crazy virtually unplayable edit the game is nearly gigabyte its a miracle it even opens at this point jfc
3,the game is good and fun to play the only thing is obtaining characters is very hard for non top up players
3,this game is not necessarily bad i simply take issue with the storage i have been trying to get four to update on my device and i simply cannot free enough space for it without my only app on this device being genshin please compress the data more
3,i would like to say this is pretty much the best game i have come across everything is great but i would very much like genish impact could gift me a diluc character because i do not know how to obtain it i have done about wishes but still have not got any characters so kindly gift me diluc
3,amazing game story lines food game play and everything it is free to play friendly too the only problem is for people on mobile devices wish it is more storage friendly cause gigabyte is such a drastic thing
3,i would give this a two if i was not so addicted the game is nice but the storage like once there is a new update you suddenly hear boss music oh lawd he comin and i get slapped with a gigabyte download the game is good i gotta give it to you its a eight ten but my storage is blowing up i cannot afford a pc hoyo this is all i got
3,very good game open world and multiplayer i am already adventure rank but the only thing i hate about this game is the storange that use this game was using gigabyte of my storange i am on phone and i heard something about the next update that was gigabyte more i reinstalled it
3,i really like this game no joke i just got a problem and that is so dumb that i need gigabyte availables just for uncompress the resources when the game is around gigabyte shoul look to optimize that so annoying
3,i liked the game there are ups and downs but does not every game on mobile there will be some problems with cut secens and connection edit goly gosh this game is large i enjoy the game and wish everyone a good time in fontaineyou are leaving me here brothers
3,games awesome but still needs to have lot of improvements in pulls and artifacts mainly artifacts they are trash most of the time and some do not even match the character design
3,probably the best game on android the only one i have played that deserves five star update when downloading updates on internet connection if the connection is lost it will start using mobile data without asking leaving me with unwanted data charges
3,i love the game but keep crashing and sending me back to my phone back screen andi am even on giga so do not know what going on but need to fixed
3,it is amazing open world and feels great graphics top notch characters are interesting all things look really fun but i could not rate this higher than three stars to justify one where is controller support two why starting characters are not on rate up three the weapons banner is the worst i do not see myself playing this game in long term andi am not gonna spend money on this game if i cannot even get copies of characters i like coz they are limited to permanent banner which is fairly disappointing
3,the game is good but please make it easy for us free to play players to get five star characters i played from adventure rank one to adventure rank and have not got five star characters at all while my friends who are still adventure rank already have five star characters mihoyo please make it easier for us players free to play in playing genshin impact thank you
3,this game is pretty awesome and the relaxing music gives me the vibes however gigabyte for a game is simply too much it is extremely difficult to manage storage plus the amount of items needed to upgrade the weapons and stuff is pretty hard to come and very annoying
3,it is very buggy the event had a lot of bugs and the game itself specially when climbing mountains it is even more annoying
3,there should be three artifact loadout build to choose from because there is no way a character especially support chars is only limited to one or two artifact set it is so hard to manually change a characters build because of this lack of feature
3,this game needs gigabyte to be updated i uninstalled it because it took up so much space i love the game and the style but i cannot update it so i cannot play at all
3,its ok i guess there so much happening and so many things to do artifacts and etc its not for a newbie with this type of game and is there a mic where cooperative players can talk to each other instead of typing
3,i really enjoyed playing genshin impact but my inazuma archon quest act two will not work i try restarting it three times and i waited tell one hour to it to play but its still black till now i have been playing for two months this is the first time this happened
3,it is a very fun game but every time i wanna play nine times out of ten the game crashes and i do not know how to fix the issue
3,im unable to login into genshin for five days straight whats wrong with genshin after the hoyoverse signature appeared it only shows white background been waiting for three minutes nothing happens please fix this problem
3,the game itself is great but i would not recommend making any purchases they charged me five and i never received the in game currency i purchased their support staff was very rude and unhelpful as well
3,i absolutely love this game especially the amazing graphics and the story but the story has been lately too childish
3,for some reason i do not know why it takes long to load and i kept on waiting and waiting for it to load and it has been ten minute of it loading and still loading
3,change the artifact drop system it is not luck based it only drop def and hp for two weeks straight that is not something i would call luck based
3,im kinda disappointed when i buy a controller i find out that it is not compatible with the android i request a controller compatible in android in your app i kinda did cost all of my allowance that time i just waste my money with my controller when it is not compatible with android
3,it is a good game but it freezes and randomly kicks me out of the game sometimes it even kicks me out during a boss fight
3,it is way too big even for a mobile or pc player it takes way too much space than usual would be nice if it was cloud gaming or somewhere we can play online without being bothered about the space issue
3,i wish i can play it but it keep on kicking me out the loading process was fine but when it loads into the game it just crashes and kicks me
3,as an free to play this is a grindy game it takes a very long time to earn primo for a desired a character if you lose a then it is game over i hope they would provide at least one five star selector from the standard banner it would be really great for free to play players
3,so fari am having a hard time to get new characters especially five stars it makes me lose the excitement to continue the game
3,although i do like genshin i waited for an hour for the data to load and when everything was finished downloading i tried to play the game but it kept freezing and kicking me out
3,the game is nice but when i installed it it needed more downloading it took ages when i checked it took minute to fully download and it took up a lot of space
3,this game is always sucks me to play you always updating with high space consumable just for events only no new maps or new quest just for events but the space you always consume is so large that is why other people want to play your game is thinking to not play this game cause the space and updates of your game is to large like my friend say he do not want to play anymore of your game cause the update is consume of large space on his phone that is is just for event only that is sucks for me think
3,too much things to do to acquire free primo and the prizes of genesis crystals battle pass and welkin got more expensive it is hard to become a small spender in this game and expect to have the characters you wish to have
3,have been playing since day one it is fabulous to my taste except when you are playing on a foldable phone hands down five stars if not for this issue the cropping for the screen ratio basically zoomed in and blurred everything and the cut scenes were cropped as well i understand it is a form factor issue however i believe there is a way for the developer to fix this personally i do not even mind to have slight black bars on the top and bottom
3,fantastic story great open world amazing exploration good sidegame tcg no real reason to play cooperative because at the end of the day the game is easy everybody knows top tier character designs voice acting and lore just insanely lacking in endgame hard content for players who enjoy the gameplay like me the gameplay is insane but only the spiral abyss is the real endgame content due to anxiety of players who does not want to clear hard content imagine implementing sim universe from hsr
3,the main problem of this game is if i stop playing it for few months then in order to play again even though i did not uninstall it i have to download gigabyte data again after opening it exclusive of updates even after entering login id and password normally most of the games save the game progress and even after months it stays the same and we can play afyer entering login id and password i hope the developers can look into this issue as soon as possible as it is ruining the game experience
3,it is a well made game but there are two issues once you are caught with the story the game is pretty boring after some time the daily quests suck so little limited resin sucks not much to do in cooperative free primo distribution is so little ik they are trying to do business but still etc etc but good graphics for mobile very nice music and story so far
3,i have a had time with the controls soi am bad at this game i also find it tedious to try to acquire new characters the art is very pretty and i like collecting the flowers but i got bored of the game if i do get back into it it will be on pc becausei am appare notly too old to learn movement controls for a style open world mobile game it might also just be thei am very bad at adapting but i find it funnier to call myself old
3,makes device super hot and unplayable for a game that requires a lot of time and focus for a mobile the problem arises when you do not have time to sit down for a good minutes to get things done and still need to manually travel it starts to feel repetitive and the game does not have an option where it respects your time it is alright at best but there is nothing left to keep my investment aside from the occasional cooperative too much to grind for as they keep releasing new characters
3,i play this game on mobile and i feel likei am being punished for it switching characters in this game is extremely important during combat so why was it made so bad there are four characters in a team but only three of them are displayed on the right at all times the constant shuffling of characters after selection makes it hard to keep track of what characteri am switching to give us an option to put all four characters on display and stop the list from shuffling
3,genshin is a great game up until you hit end game where it stagnates i think that the balancing of the adventure rank was poorly done and created an issue where end game players are just suffering the repitition issue really needs a fix and events are not gonna fix it the whole daily system and weekly pass needs a revamp and if it does not get one endgame players are gonna start dropping by the way this is speaking as a person who has put a lot of money into the game too
3,i played since launch and the game was truly beautiful and addicting at first lots of potential wasted there is no skip buttons on dialogue and the quests are starting to become a slog of filler dialogue extremely repetitive lategame open world becomes a chore and fights are braindead or gimmicky strict and stingy event schedule where ifyou are a new player or missed it a major story event is gone forever due to no archive or re runs essentially throwing their devs time into the trash
3,my game has started lagging yet again i cannot even finish a single commission the game crashes when i try to teleport the game crashes when i try to reply something during cooperative and when i try to fight the enemies it lags so much its infuriating my network is actually pretty fast so i do not know why this keep happening to me pleass fix it asap
3,the backgrounds are beautiful the character design is just amazing and the plot is perfect it is an amazing game and i highly recommend it that is my review from two years ago and while i still love the game it has problems like not being able to download the app for an upgrade then having to deleting google play app data also it takes a lot of storage just to run properly while this did effect my game play it might not effect yours so while it not to bad i still recommend it
3,pro amazing solo game wide world to explore tons of activity and quest to chase very nice player treatment with events and access to shop and materials enemy lv up also as you lv up so always a difficult challenge heavy grind con solo game anti cooperative the game actually punishes you for playing cooperative with friends while openworld boss are easier to team up against dungeon enemy gets buffed quest are not shared quest gets locked in multiplayer absolutely no reason to play with friends
3,not bad not great either but not bad i played since launch up until a year and a half ago back when it was still good the game right now is just a grindy artifact mess if you wanna get anywhere thenyou are gonna have to devote your life and your life savings to this game the story personally i could give or take the first two arcs were actually enjoyable but the rest that followed was kinda meh i stopped playing roughly after they added inazuma the third major region horrendous gacha
3,i both love and hate this gamei am still playing and enjoying it but there are so many things that i find frustrating i love that its casual and requires less time commitment the combat system is good and it is periodic events are quite creative but it is unfriendly to new players for reasons i cannot get into cos of char limit i appreciate that they do not obfuscate the gacha currency like other games but they are also very miserly by comparison the artifact stat system is too random
3,its a good game for newbies but as an end game it has several problems there is no end game content for testing maximum potential of builds and characters also artifact drop rates and resin system is so annoying too after doing the story quest once a month you really do not have other things to do its all boring daily commissions and weekly activities there is also boring non combat events too cooking taking picture for a better experience in combat this game truly need an end game content
3,i enjoy the story the graphics the cooperative the characters and events but recently i had a major issue i usually play on my laptop but i ran out of space for genshin on it so after a little under a month i managed to get an external hardisk and everything i needed to connect it to my laptop but when i went to redownload genshin i was no longer able to it said network error when i was using my phones giga on the first of january i tried again in february but it is still not working
3,the game is great honestly i should be giving it five stars instead of three buti am holding back because there is one problem i cannot seem to find a fix for uncomfortable user interface layout i want to move the direction pad where i want it and the game has no features for user interface placement that aside it is probably the best story game on the whole market would recommend a decent phone or gaming phone your iphone eight is not going to cut it please create a user interface customizable option in the settings
3,im both a ps and mobile player and i have played since one ish so quite a while i have gotten this on mobile to play with my friends on a driffernt server but i have noticed a few things which kinda bumped this down to a three star firstly this is not a beginner friendly game at the moment what i mean is that the characters on the current banners level up materials are locked behind places you cannot get to early game making it hard to advance with those characters would put more but word limit
3,i absolutely adore this game the graphics are beautiful and the story is just amazing not to mention the characters are beautifully designed with likable personalities that makes me just fall in love with the game however ever since the three four update came out my genshin impact has been stuck on pending every time i tried to update it is there any reason for this please let me know
3,i will give it a three star due to every time if i want to download it will will say that my storage is not big enough and i always delete some apps and games that might had been the reason but it did not always fix the problem i had the game back in or i remember but anyways the game was fun it just needs some fixing in order for us to play and actually have fun
3,it is a good game story is good most events are very fun i really enjoy playing however my good gaming experience has been deteriorating in each and every update due to the size of the game sure i am fully aware that voice lines and quests can be uninstalled through the paimon menu but its really annoying that you need to uninstall them after each and every update you download so please make it so if you delete files they do not automatically download themselves every time you download the game
3,needs controller support playing this on my tablet with touch screen i do not like ios has controller support give it to us for android i play this game on occasion for pc where i can use mouse and keyboard but would love to be able to sit back and relax in my living room and watch tv with my wife and play this game with a controller bitdo pro two would be amazing on this
3,you are going to need more than gigabyte free space to install this game hopefully external storage options will work rating it three simply cause onei am forced to click a star and second i cannot really determine gameplay atm though storage requirements are deceiving since it technically says gigabyte would be more than enough but otherwise ignore my temporary rating just letting people know storage requirements are greater than shown to install and update
3,i love this app so much it is a great game but the character designs are not very great specifically in sumeru sumeru is based off of the middle east india turkey etc and a lot of characters have inaccurate designs based off of the culture for example dori has a turkish inspired design but there are many inaccurate parts a lot of characters are also whitewashed why is the other regions accurate based off of cultural designs but not sumeru also primo are too hard to earn
3,great game and whatnot but one glitches like a lot a lot of the time my gameplay resets because of these glitches and also i cannot really play because i cannot tell whats happening two this goes along with the glitches but when it glitches it makes my whole phone crash i love the game and characters but the glitching is not ideal
3,i am an end game player and i must say i still love it the way i used to when i first installed this i was a bit skeptical initially since the size of the game is huuge but given its beautiful graphics i can see why my only complain is that the rpg system is truly fricked up and the resin cap should be increased other than that i am also concerned about safety issues since there has been a wave of hackers it is still an amazing game though with a perfect balance of everything
3,the game is okay and all but the problems are it lack of dark skinned characters no plus sized character the characters barely look like the ones their bases of off their skin is literally so close to paper white playing the game is more like a chore now and the designs are so plain and its sort of horrible no offense though sorry i just wish the designs were as unique as the honkai and star rail designs
3,a great open world experience with lots of different characters and their unique abilities where the incentive to spend money depends on if you like a certain character or not instead of needing to get certain characters to clear certain stages which makes the game fairly free to play friendly but still some quality of life feature are missing even after two years like dialogue skip button for when the story becomes the same as reading a page on wikipedia
3,i started playing during the end of one five and i gotta say it is not a bad game at all there is many problems in the fandom but the game itself is great some problems in the game however are no representation not a lot of stuff to do after adventure rank and it becomes hard to get primo glitches lag and the biggest problem of all storage this game was gigabytes on my pc and gigabytes on my phone i literally had to quit because of storage the lore is good though by the way
3,playing since launch two years and have thoroughly enjoyed combat exploration events etc but there are some elements of the game that are not to my taste the rng is bad from trying to power up your artifacts getting good artifacts to just getting a character you want the positive being there is a pity system but you potentially have to spend wishes approx to get the character you want lastly is the lack of character roadmaps and time to prepare for upcoming characters
3,great game good open world exploration and building characters is not too hard to understand however after a certain point it gets stale becauseyou are done exploring and all you can do to gain gems is do daily commissions and use resin and play the event if there is one furthermore spiral abyss is available however it is very hard to fully complete without spending money on the game also the character rates are not the best but i have seen worse
3,it was a really good start after that it can get boring though it is too addicting and long termed if you want a simple game and not put so much effort into it then i recommend this game is not for you the characters kind of talk too much which can be boring but you can skip through it downloading all the files takes too much storage space and people quit for that reason there are a ton more adventures coming meaning more updates and inhaling chunks of storage space good luck handling it
3,one of my favorite games for a while but flaws became too hard to ignore story is great for the most part each version has a pretty good central event and the characters are all interesting genshins main problem is the sheer amount of rng it is a gacha game with an eh gacha system but the problem is artifacts getting one good artifact takes so many levels of rng andyou are limited to very few new artifacts each day due to the very low resin cap good game but it has flaws that ruin it
3,overall the game is good the graphics gameplay story and all that i just hope there is a way in a smartphone users to customize the buttons make it easier for us to play the game thank you especially a dark mode of loading screen edit the game has many users right now so they will not look at the comments ps please add gamepad controller option on android users
3,it is a fun game and feels like playing an expansion of breath of the wild but touch controls are a nuisance in any fps tps style game without controller support on android i will not be playing genshin impact there is no reason for this game to not support an xbox controller since android has xbox controller support out of the box microsoft has made it easy and free for developers to implement controller support on android i will update my review and play when controller support is added
3,lately the game has been lagging and crashing despite having good ping moderate graphics no other apps open good battery life while using it and the tablets storage is not full it is inconvinient because it keeps crashing whilei am in the middle of a fight puzle and this is the first time it happened for over a year of playing
3,graphics five gameplay five probably the best game when it came out but now its just a chore nothing else to do not hing else to find you play the game to do not hing so why play it at all story updates are very slow and rewards for playing are just bad most are probably still playing because they already invested a lot of money and just forcing themselves to have funi am pretty sure the problem is not in the game but its in the people who manage it edit updates are getting better keepitup
3,the game is alright the problem i had in pc version is that it would not let me enter the game i have putting my account there and it keep sending errors even though i have been putting the right password in it and also the mobile version would randomly crash i have been downloading for like an hour the distorted voicelines game physics lagging and freezing my phone hoyoverse please fix the bugs and glitches and the log in error
3,man i actually think this game manages to do a lot right but far more wrong the adventuring part of the game which is also built up within the story as well dies off quickly as you progress and begins to feel less rewarding should not it be the opposite among the other enjoyable aspects of the game they all give way in a similar manner to reveal the underlying gacha system what could be the new standard for mobile games is nothing more than a fancy money grab and the devs know it
3,genshin impact is a very pretty game with a lot of fun mechanical ideas used pretty well but it puts a lot of roadblocks in the way of enjoying any of that there are so many resources that funnel into so many types of progression that it quickly turns into the least fun kind of resource grinding i like casual grinding in other games but when the main story becomes almost unplayable because i did not grind a half dozen types of upgrade material for multiple characters it is frustruating at best
3,pros unique combat system using elemental reactions bgm and overworld design is immersive great story and characters with huge world to explore cons anxiety yes i read the article that aside the reason for two star was the lack of love for it is players especially free to play and the greedy business model that earns billion still recommended if you like arpg with exploration but it is not worth to invest and spend money if the future you get is only new weaker characters and expanding tedious world
3,i like the game the storyline plot sceneries charactersi am glad that you fixed the signora yun jin and dvalin glitch though it would be a wonderful experience if you were to change the glitch where you cannot see ice also with the text damage which is really bothering me because it is hard to showcase or see your characters damage that is all i have to say
3,im experiencing conflicting thoughts on one hand the game is really fun it is a casual game you can log onto and play for a while walk away for the day and come back later to play a bit more on the other hand it has some major flaws and the devs refuse to acknowledge or fix such as resin refresh layers of rng on everything and tons of limited events that have key information relating to characters and story i could go on longer buti am limited on characters
3,i want to say it is good i want to praise the game for its amazing story and great character design i want to talk about how great the animations are and how beautiful the effects and environments is in this game but i cannot genshin impact does so much right but forgets that a very large amount of its player base is mobile players and for far too long genshin has remained a game that is poorly optimized for android phones rendering it almost unplayable i will try the game again if fixed
3,still a hit or miss the free to play rewards are improving as seen on the hoyolab events but it is still not enough to warrant continue playing its very abysmal compared to the time spent on the game but for me i will continue playing because i like the aesthetic the designs the music and the gameplay so far it is not been that bad
3,honestly really good game like really good but for me too many things started coming up in terms of things we could do i personally prefer the focus more on the story line rather than side quests and other tasks and for me it can become a bit much otherwise wonderful game now starting to see many other games take on similar animation this game literally changing mobile games from other providers so well done
3,it is been a while since it happened but first anniversary good second anniversary rewards and i will change review also not very free to play friendly and takes up a lot of storage the storage problem is fine on pc but sucks on mobile it is very laggy for me whenever i play on mobile and have to close all my other apps otherwise a pretty good game
3,i kinda want a mount rider for traveling in the land so that you can enjoy the scenery more like the wave rider in the water bodies of inazuma and sumeru it is nice and relaxing when your questing teleporting from place to place is convenient but it gets boring and walking is slow while running dashing needs stamina and boring climbing automatically is annoying when your fighting your character suddenly climb on something can climbing be manual overall the game is good and its fun
3,its a good game with lots of puzles and adventure very addicting game but there is things that make me upset like one power creeping its a problem not most people care about but for some people there favorite character will slowly be unusable in the coming months and new characters will thrive in the meta making people uninterested in playing two not listening to the community hoyovers is known to not listen to the players especially with character bugs fix or character buffs they never listen
3,i love this game really i do the story is great the animation for big scenes are absolutely beautiful i mean seriously this game has great graphics but there are big issues in this game that others have criticized time and time again that hoyoverse simply has not acknowledged seriously the diversity issue especially with the new sumeru update artifact system as well has been a huge complaint and difficulty has been a huge issue in inazuma good game hoyoverse just will not listen
3,this was a brilliant game i really enjoyed playing it every day but now i keep getting error code and it will not download the newest update i have tried uninstalling reinstalling switching storage to an external sd card clearing the cache data giving the app storage permissions nothing has worked i would like to keep playing but i cannot until this error is fixed or until they release a version on mac switch
3,it is a really fun game just recently i have had some issues first i do play on chrombeook because finically it is the best i can do but it crashes after preparing to load data second there is not any controller support and it is stuck using the mobile layout which is a pain for non touchscreen devices third and finially there are some asset files that simply do not download for example dvalin is wings crystals and glowing eyes no neck or body overall i love the game but cannot play
3,good polished game and sets a new standard but gets really repetitive events feels more like another amusement park you have visited before many things are simply recycled from assets that exists from launch for example character animations used in new story cutscenes are obviously old ones it feels very amateurish and low budget even source film maker creators put more effort than this developers have gained their money already and seems to change their focus to the new projects
3,gameplay is great world is beautiful even with limited graphics and characters and their designs are amazing however there are numerous problems lack of content besides from limited events artifact grinding taking a copious amount of time etc however the biggest problem for me right now is how often the servers disconnect my internet connection is fine i have changed it before and my phone ran it fine before this issue makes the game almost unplayable and it happens way too often every five minutes
3,this used to be a five star review because of how great i thought the game was in the beginning i love the graphics characters and nations but there are just so many glaring issues recently that i cannot ignore the story used to be my favorite part of the game but in inazuma it quickly became convoluted and frankly boring the resin system is flawed and makes it impossible to grind endgame gameplay is non existent rewards for playing are very low and really make it hard to want to continue
3,this is my second mobile review the game is great and for all of it is content it deserves a five star review if not more unfortunately a lot of that content is impossible to access to new players time event main story parts major mechanics and gameplay styles and whole locations a good third of the entire game and old players get to the arrifact hell a time gated cruel and utterly boring rng based grind that is worse and longer than by most mmo and looter shooter standards
3,while this game is amazing it has a few flaws for on chromebook do not get me wrong its a good game i have it on my phone but for chrombook it is not that great first of all i spent over an hour trying to get past the introi am still not past it due to immense amounts of lag the screen is also blank i have no clue what happend either another thing is on chrombook you should add pc controls or the option to change them instead of just having moble controls thanks
3,i love the game but the issue of resin limits my enjoyment and i really wish there is a skip option on the story or dialogues i get it though a story for you to understand and know the character or any but here i am taping like a maniac to finish asap to continue playing cause i have things to do or arrive super tired and i do not have the energy to endure all a skip will let me enjoy it and i could read it later on the game archieves cause i really appreciate the though on every stor
3,lovely game amazing graphics great story line but there are many flaws first off there should be much more representation in this game there are few characters that are not snow white and every character is thin second off players do not get as many rewards as they should and third off the game gets very boring very quickly i am adventure rank achieved every quest every event and much more which just makes the game less fun i personally would love more world quests thank you
3,i like the game a lot but there is quite a few problems with it the gacha system is too expensive it is hard to collect primo every day just for a couple wishes without buying any levelling up in adventure ranks is very difficult as well there are only so many things you can do day to collect experience the amount it all gives you is also really low the third and final problem is just how big the game is i have had to delete so many other things just to be able to even download the game
3,since i do not own a device with a lot of capacity i might eventually have to stop playing this game which i have been playing for nearly a year regarding that issuei am hoping the genshin team would scale down the games overall size as it takes up a lot of room on computers and i cannot even begin to imagine how much space it would take up if all the regions were added
3,uh it is kinda boring now it is a stunning game but there is little to no endgame content and the pity system is extremely unfair and annoying the game creators have barely any representation of black cultures with characters and designs other than a few other problems the game is a solid rpg mmo game with fun gameplay lots of characters and cool characters animations the lore of the game is very deep and is all explained or yet to be this is not a grindy game so play once every few days
3,been playing since and when it first was released it felt like there were so much to do however genshin impact has not added any sustainable content since release except new domains and bosses each requiring resin for the first three while the rest is resin resin is capped out at per day and one takes eight minutes to regenerate so to get all your resin back it takes minutes this is a major issue for players who are willing to commit to the game or have played for a long time
3,the game is good has a story world and characters that keep me coming back and i play regularly on pc but it turns out you kind of need a relatively newish phone to play the mobile version granted my phone is not super old but the mobile version should not be so unstable that it is a gamble if i can even get past the title screen it feels like while this is a good looking game for mobile it is the fact that it is so graphically intensive that keeps it from being playable on mobile
3,the dialogue is a bit slow and cut scenes cannot be skipped but the game is fun a bit tedious on grinding for the mats for wishes character weapon summons best part is being able to carry your account from platform to platform update would also like to add that the game needs a fast forward option for the dialogue a skip feature for any all cut scenes better camera management during combat it is constantly sinking into the dirt and characters get knocked over by the slightedof breezes
3,still a good game though i only use mobile for purchases and primarily play on pc i wish the game did not time gate as much and expanded the ability to play more at the users own pace regardless of how fast it slow they would like to go through content but understand the game is still in development and this may not be feasible at this time i hope they do consider increasing resin improving drop rates and attribute rates on artifacts and updating the standard banner as the game matures
3,played for more than a year or so but the problem is that the commissions are repetitive the game events are not really desirable over time and you will eventually get boredi am rating it as three stars since the game needs significant improvements in terms of these things i have mentioned also forcing players to play for the commissions and their welkin moon is kind of annoying to me there should be a convenient feature for the welkin moon that charges you more but you do not have to log in
3,this game is great i played it for a few months and id say i recommend it the graphics are so beautiful there are tons of interesting characters the story is interesting and you can freely explore the open world but some parts are tedious and also sometimes the game crashes or goes slow i played it on many different devices and the same keeps happening also once you make the missions that you can and you need to level up to do the next one sometimes is too tedious and you can do not hing
3,have been playing the game for a week now everything seems perfect and fun except for the monstrous size of the app and the data it consumes during each update it would be more efficient if the players could configure what additional file to download or not as per there choice just like pubg apex ledgen or even like league of ledgens
3,it is not for me for starters i do not understand the appeal of generic anime art but thought it was worth a try since it is so popular i do not enjoy the strange character switching mechanic and can already see how they will make buying characters seem necessary for many players whilei am fine with games having some micro transactions i think it should only be for fluff i would rather buy a game outright even so it ran very smoothly on my tablet and the sheer size of the map was impressive
3,this game was a great play not too long ago it had great captivating graphics and the lore was interesting the new update has made this game unplayable on my phone the graphics are quite bad the frame rate is below and it is constantly freezing or crashing i cannot move two steps without the game shutting down great game ifyou are phone can handle all of the new data with each update
3,great game battle mechanics and graphics are really smooth quite a lot to learn in the beginning so it may be quite confusing the only downside side is the rng mechanic of the game five edit after patch two four the texts on mobile for the wish banner and updates are extremely zoomed in where it is inconvenient and makes navigating through surveys and wish history very difficult and annoying in game currency given to the player is low compared to others slow paced game without much to do
3,i love the game and i pop on from time to time but i hopped on again after a long while i play on my laptop as well both my phone and computer use the same account but when i tried to get on mobile it is acting likei am a new player and asking me to pick a twin please fix account restarts i think you would call it i do not know it is just weird that my account data is suddenly gone
3,long process to follow through this game is not made for phones because the file is quite large the story every traveler experiences is a long journey to complete the game has a larger map to wander through the cooperative is now more wide open to friends and viewers for streamers to interact with the system slowly but surely will be more likable to new players i would wish myself that if possible there was not such a difficult weapon banner for players to struggle with
3,really enjoy this game two issues one ios has wireless controller support but android does not that is absurd please fix it two the process of pairing a save file between devices console and android for example has a very specific sequence that needs to be followed otherwise you have to beg customer support to unlink one device which takes potentially more than a week and a half this sequence is not explained clearly except for on forums which you go to after you have gotten it wrong
3,pros one it is a beautifully crafted world with a rich story and lovable characters two the combat is fun and the exploration is enough to keep one adventuring for a while three you can tell that the developers put so much love into this game but the marketing division it is a mess and that leads me to cons one certain systems time gating remain broken since launch two rng on top of rng three predatory monetization four too much focus on money not enough on fixing content all in all solid
3,great game ifyou are here for the experience i would argue even the best one out there however if you were to stay here for long you gonna have to deal with a variety of problems from devs not fixing the most simple mistakes for years no joke to blantly ignoring their community when they are unhappy probably the most significant issue with this game is that it does not allow you to play whenever you want to play it afteryou are done with the quests so instead it becomes a second job
3,okay mobile game awful story writing with a lot of unecessary dialogue characters are well designed and mostly balanced but some have years old glitches left unfixed while they continue to pile on new characters e giga dionas skill and burst still hit objects instead of enemies even when they are closer than the objects wish there were more settings we could mess with obviously pay to win
3,it is a good game and free to play friendly i just installed this after a long time i left but it has has a very troublesome problem which you were downloading the resources and suddely the internet connection become sucks or you quit halfway your current progress will be loss as you will start to the very beginning of your download the game cannot detect its game file such a waste of time
3,its great i have been playing since launch basically so it is been a fun time for sure but i cannot say its perfect for newer players it will be difficult to level up certain characters due to materials being locked until you reach certain levels or clear certain areas i do not think i would recommend it for a casual player but someone whos going to marathon the game in like a week should not have too much of a problem
3,i would have to say that this game is an exceptional one in terms of lore quality the beauty of going on adventure and experiencing fantasy however it is not friendly to new players there is a lot a new player must overcome in order to truly experience what a lot of us veteran players do new player lock out is a definitely driving those who wish to enjoy the game away especially if they are bound to start off as mobile players this needs to be fixed and so does the resin system
3,definitely a good game i play it a lot on pc and i downloaded it for chromebook because google play said it was compactible which it is but sadly the graphics are set to be high as a default on mobile and it always crashes every time i enter the door and reach the loading screen the game really needs a settings option outside of the game or have default graphics values to be lower please do this change
3,im only giving it three because the actual game is good but the mobile version is a pain the hyakunin ikki event is one example it takes many tries to get enough points to get the first rewards and the reason is not that i cannot defeat the enemies it is that the enemies take an actual minute to spawn all the time trials in the mobile version have this issue too the objectives do not spawn in under ten seconds the laggy cutscenes in quests are unbearable when you actualty care about the story
3,fun at first however not much is explained very well for new players leaving most people to find out through trial and error open map puzles have hardly any hints on how to do them and the rewards for those puzles and the entire game for that matter are very lackluster gear for characters can take months depending on your luck gameplay and visuals are nice but take up so much space overall rng based gameplay for anything you actually need to play
3,i love this game fun game play good map but the only problem is it takes too much space this is like the only game i can have it takes storage to download every good part of the gameplay but i seriously cannot get one other app i really hate that part of genshin but although it takes too much space it is a fun game if it is possible please lower the amount of space genshin impact uses to run smoothly or i will not be able to talk to my friends thank you
3,it is a great game overall good graphics nice gameplay and a really inmersive story with beautiful characters tailored so everyone finds a favorite but the games big flaw is in mechanics i swear when it comes to farming most things are not so hard to get but artifacts which are indispensable for actually using a character you like are so boring and tedious to aquire you will probably end up dropping the game after you have to farm for them you should think over that hoyoverse
3,great to a point i played this on phone and playstation although there is a point where you get stuck unless you have a lot of friends that play too one area you cannot complete without a full team of players there needs to be guilds to complete for those who have friends just not interested in this type of game otherwise your stuck and cannot progress ending all the work you have completed which is a huge downfall for the game itself if you can get multiple friends to play cool go for it
3,first of all this game is good good graphics good music and good story but it is lagging and consume more battery and give us the option to twick the draw distance because it load the metres away mountain and that is what makes the game lag most of the time the camera is far far away from the character if it is near the character i would be immersed in the gameplay the camera zoom is not helping because after some times the camera comes to the normal position
3,i was recommended this game a lot by my friends but it just does not work well on android every time it gets to the wearing headphones may improve your gaming experience part the game usally crashes and closes down also the loading takes way too long as well as the dowloading
3,i just updated it and when i get in the second loading screen finish it give me reconnecting to server before go to loading screen again it fine for like a few times but it keeps on repeating like more than times already my line is fine too i try again the next day and it is still like that it keeps on repeating and it is not like i can properly log out like this it is getting annoying
3,its a great game the visuals along with it being playable on computer as well as my phone with the same account and enabling crossplay is great the only let down and to me it is worth two stars is the lack of controller support if when they add it i will update but till then i will have to play it on computer
3,has quite some issues bugs in characters that is never been fixed ridiculously high prices for in game currency that just is not justifiable at this point poor storylines complete ignorance when it comes to complaints by international players the list could go on and on extreme high usage of storage space however it is still an amazing game stunning sceneries graphics characters and events i enjoy this game more than anything else but i hope there will be some changes in the future
3,the downloading resources is repeating back to zero i waited for several hours to download it to gigabyte i paused it and i decided to continue it later but it back to start again repeating me to download gigabyte resources i did not reset or clear anything and the storage of this game is here filling my phone storage i repeat it two times but it did not work back to start again
3,i play on pc because this game refuses to load on my phone the game overall is amazing with one of the best elemental systems i have ever seen it can be laggy on pc and takes up a huge amount of space it is very large for a mobile game and despite having uninstalled and reinstalled changed phones used internet connection ect it never goes past the loading screen it is my favorite game but i do not see how playing on mobile is even viable considering the sheer size of the game
3,the game is really good with the aspects of character designs storyline and the battle mechanics the only thing that bugs me is the resin even ifyou are trying to build up a good character or you want to go for domains you cannot get anything nor can you upgrade anything ifyou are out of resin just increase the amount of resin permanently or just reduce the time in which the resin accumulates
3,i have been playing for a while now and i absolutely love this game however after the two four update i noticed that everytime i use an elemental burst of a five star character to a number of enemies or group of enemies and bosses all of their hp bar disappears including those that i did not use it to even the names of npcs disappear and is disrupting my gameplay it is draining and time consuming to restart the game everytime i use my characters burst so i hope that this can be fixed thanks
3,i usually play it on my laptop and i liked it so much i wanted to play on my mobile device until i removed several apps and pictures videos and still was not able to download it the amount of space this game takes up for mobile is unreal to the point of litterally being unrealistic it takes up about one four one three of my phones total storage however on pc it is a wonderful game and if you have the storage capacity i encourage you to try it the graphics and fighting mechanics are wonderful
3,updates suck on android i have done pre downloads and even new versions always mess up getting on and i have to completely uninstall reinstall the game sometimes like now even that does not work soi am writing this since i cannot even get on the game i love the game in general but getting resources to get new characters is extremely time consuming considering they only give you five to primo for a majority of the quests ps is easier by far for both gameplay and updates
3,i do not like giving it a three star it is one of the best and most advanced games on the store right now but it does not justifies the space it takes the game is already big but also a lot of unnecessary stuff is takes up space even after they are over event cinematics etc there should be option to not download or remove this unnecessary stuff the game can be adjusted better for mobile too even the best phones turns into demo of hell after minutes of playing this
3,its awesome i would give it a five star if there were not any problems in my game play everytime i play ofc i log in so the problem is i do not know how many minute i can play but everytime i do smth like fighting enemies the game starts lagging and the screen turns back and kicks me out and when i am in cooperative and that happens all my progress is restarted i hope this gets fixed because i really wanna play genshin while on the go
3,gacha impact is a game where you collect scannotily clad mostly under age women and some dudes and fight monsters the game is great gameplay is responsive and flashy the game falls apart pretty quick pay your time or pay with money to make stupid inconveniences go away once progression is really important in games and this game wants to monetize that to encourage you to spend as much money as possible games get so much better than this
3,i really love the game and the fun gameplays and events that they have to offer however i would love to recommend with others to play the game i have some problems whenever i play it for a short amount of time the game ends up lagging completely and crashes not only the app but my phone as well i have to wait for about minute with the screen of a character i last played with their attacks and skills up still in a time freeze this happened too many times andi am worried for future players
3,played in the beginning left for a while wanted to get back in for the anniversary but they really dropped the ball for anniversary with the weak ten pull this game has a fairly unreasonable pay structure for rewards the lack of resin has always been a huge problem this game was well received initally and i had high hopes it is too bad there have not been positive changes to improve enjoyment for the players overall
3,would love it if the game was optimized better it takes up quite a lot of space heats up the phone eats up the battery and lags heavily on slightly older phones a friend had to unfortunately drop this game altogether due to the increasing size andi am worried many others including myself will be affected as well all in all a great game love the open worldness and gorgeous atmosphere alongside wonderful music storyline is engaging with promising characters to boot
3,had to change my review though this game is made well filled with wonderful characters and story the game has slowed down to a crawl content is slow coming events are lackluster and boring the events that are fantastic should be simply in the game available to everyone at anytime it is sad that some of these events will never return resulting in new players in missing out on all the fantastic lore provided
3,it is my favourite game and i am very dedicated to it but there is a flaw in the game which bugs the hell out of me the wangshu quest disables co operative mode until completion but for me and many others the quest is not operating properly so i have to sweep it under the rug but that is impossible due to the fact i need co operative mode to make the game enjoyable
3,this game has a lot of issues that are hard to excuse but the parts that are fun are fun it would take a lot of time to get into all of the issues but to touch on some of them it seems like the characters that are struggling and need help will not get it inconsistent mechanics that seemed a randomly apply to one character but not all there is a lot of dead time do not pull in the weapon banner unless you intend to spend a lot of money rewards for completing quests seem really lackluster
3,tl dr be prepared to be disappointed ifyou are a gacha player who likes to grind play a lot but in general its very enjoyable many problems appeae in the form of of end content and the energy timegated system to get artifacts progress for better gear the story is very enjoyable but do not expect something well written a lot of character problems event rewards are okay but itself very boring to play there is no replayable content side quests can become very tiresome and the gacha is insane
3,after playing for one year genshin impact is an amazing game at the surface level great world building character designs combat system story and graphics however going deeper into the game it has many glaring issues that have not been addressed lack of endgame content high effort for low rewards qol changes resin system artifact rng overpriced gacha and the recent downgrading of story and characters the game becomes increasingly disappointing and a daily chore in the end
3,edit one of the greatest open world animethetic action rpgs of this time world character design is amazing and a joy to explore while listening to enchanting orchestral osts combat and grinding gets abit boring after a while but that is due to endgame but most of the latest characters need extreme balancing and any new players will be sol until they spend hours of main story extra weeks of grinding adventure rank to be able to upgrade them mats are adventure rank region locked this system makes no sense
3,i am new to this game so far i enjoy playing it my only suggestion is that they must not bar adventurers from leveling up their ranks because god it is so hard to do the ascension task at level though my heroes are at a higher level with the right element to combat the electro hypostasis still my heroes were underpowered it is so tiring to play and deal with them over and over again you should also consider hero replacements if your deployed heroes were all down haha
3,it is a great game but it would be greater if it has controller support another issue in the mobile version is that sometimes objects takes a long time to load and the interact button is sometimes late also the resin refresh rate feels like forever and the cost for just one wish is just too much with those odds of winning a four five star character
3,the game is so good early on and i have no major problems with the gacha for enjoyments sake it is free to play friendly there is also a small subscription option welkin bp for low spenders which is good in my personal opinion as well however resin is a major problem with this game specially at end game you get your characters you pull and get weapons then what to do with them it is frustrating that you can only fight a couple of bosses a couple of domains then you get random drops which do not amount to any upgrade andyou are done for the day at this point it is a daily login app not a game
3,a beautiful game many amazing characters and places to visit powerful weapons however sometimes the lack of communication and basic rewards with fans is frustrating especially adventure rank rewards the amount of resin needs to be adjusted as well as artifact rng we also need more reasons to play for more than minutes later into the game the only thing you end up doing is logging in doing commissions burning resin and logging off it often just feels like a chore
3,i enjoy the game but the rng gacha system being on basically everything really pulls it back it is even on the stats of the gear itself and there is no way to change them so you just have to continue griding and pray more cooperative things to do would be very nice balancing for characters is not the best also no controller support for android after a year really sucks all that said it is very pretty and nice music story can be good to
3,honest review game is beautiful honestly have not seen mobile games come close in terms of graphics and music score for beginners the game is fine but as you progress you realize the multiple issues this games has resin needs adjustments and the higher ups should listen to the community in terms of these issues it is also very free to play but pulling a character especially one you want is very difficult and expensive especially when you have decide between saving primo or not
3,it gets very repetitive after a while and dialogues are way to long every new character you get is unusable unless you would be able to upgrade them to the same level as other characters and upgrades takes a lot of time the android version does not support controller which is not very optimal
3,good game but the resin system needs a rework it was fine when the game first came out due to limited amount of characters but seeing as we have double the amount of characters to farm for now the resin regeneration and cap needs to be much higher than before also the game is also quite lacking in end game content with only the spiral abyss dps check at the moment if there could be some kind of boss raid cooperative content would be much appreciated
3,awesome game beautiful art style huge open world map incredible ost really nice characters but keeps accumulating bugs who never get fixed or addressed the history writing recently got real rushed and bad character comes half baked on gameplay and their relevance on history is almost non existent even side characters have way more relevance and impact than the playable ones additionally the lack of proper communication throw down the mayor positive aspects of the game unfortunately
3,the gameplay world and music is fantastic but the lack of communication and community interactivity lately has been the most abysmal i have seen with a gacha this game started out very strong in these aspects but they have deteriorated at an alarming rate i do not mind the lack of rewards for anniversary but i just wish there was more fanfare more communication and transparency acknowledge problems instead of trying to sweep them under a rug and say they are going to be fixed
3,while the game itself is not bad it has become boring where there are less stuff to do there are a lot of re works of many characters that needs to be done i would also like to address the underwhelming reward of the anniversary where everything are web event and less in game content that has a few rewards
3,you are doing great with the map expansions puzles are fun finding secret hidden chest is fun doing hidden quest is fun but exploring the map with maxed out characters is boring because you can do one hit per kill please add high risk zones for maxed out characters make us feel that we still need healers while exploring maps
3,the beginning experience is fun but at endgame the content becomes very dry and there is nothing meaningful to do outside of waiting for energy over time the devs started to get more careless and stopped acknowledging player feedback as much they have ignored multiple bugs with characters that have been there for a long time and now with the anniversary they have essentially ignored the player base entirely sad to see aside from that the characters are pretty cool
3,great game but there is still room for improvement please raise resin from to and condense resin from five to ten more cost halving opportunities for weekly bosses artifact sets are hard to complete please implement a rotation for the pieces the game visuals and soundtrack are ten out of ten it is just that if we go into the stage of filler patches again then we need the resin system to improve play at your own risk this game has greedy management
3,it was a really fun game however the endgame content felt like chores everyday there is no more adventure and fun and challenge besides the spiral abyss which is relatively easy for some but still rewards are so cheap and even for a gacha it still requires you to put so much money and effort into even getting to their pity which does not even guarantee the five star you want sometimes the soundtrack and graphics are amazing but on what has happened during these past few weeks is really bad
3,a fun blend action rpg adventure game with rather impressive visuals soothing soundtrack solid stories and fun characters the game is just stuck with a very tedious boring and sometimes frustrating endgame where it ends up being a massive grindfest and a highly predatory gacha system where all but five of the highest rarity units are limited to event specific banners also the company is mad stingy with its anniversary rewards
3,used to be a really good game but the recent quests feel rushed and the plot was anti climatic it is starting to feel superbly unfriendly to free to play players and rewards have been disappointing there is nothing much to do daily and farming rarely gives anything good lore in the game now feels stale and even though they created a good setting for inazuma the promotional posters and built up suspense was useless by the end of the quest
3,developer does not listen to feedback despite putting out a survey after every major update several characters are completely worthless or suffer from bugs which remain unfixed six months after their release resin system heavily limits gameplay as almost everything relies upon it would rate higher if they simply addressed issues since the base gameplay is actually very good
3,very good game easy to hook have some small issues which i always feedbacked but seem like not to fix anytime soon music and gameplay is great story characters and mechanic system are good at first but become unbalanced and go slightly downhill maybe because of rushing or low quality control while the game itself is great it is still have a lot of drawback recommended to gacha veteran and lover
3,been playing for a year now and all i can say is that the resin system needs improvement as for it is hard to farm for artifacts and materials with resin per day as well the rewards are somewhat stingy not enough for wishes which makes you pay real money for the wanted character weapon great storyline and graphics really like how a open world game that does not really limit you to something is finally on mobile
3,initially the game was awesome hands down it was the best i had ever played wrt graphics scenery characters and story the only disappointment is not the rewards but the lack of consideration towards the player base the story and world building is hands down the best but the pace at which updates roll are slow but frequent the amount of time it actually takes for the story to move on is too long and tires out many people like me minimal spender and if you miss a day you feel like you have lost something precious you have been building up i do not want more rewards hecki am fine with what we already have but please put more lore and give characters like lisa kaeya and amber more love so we can like them for who they are as characters and not the colorful numbers that pop up on the screen oh and where is ludi harpastum we were supposed to get that too right
3,the game is great beautiful scenery and music the story is great characters are amazing and its a very unique and enjoyable but as you progress there is lack of any sort of end game content except for the spiral abyss which please instead of making floor and worse just add more floors or add something new also please communicate with your players and listen to what they want its a lovely experience here and we want it to be better thanks
3,the graphics are beautiful the world is fun to explore the character design is amazing the music is also very nice it is a fun game in general but it needs a lot of effort to do stuff that just give you low rewards like the first anniversary you can give free stuff for promotions you can give a free four star for an event but sth better than ten wishes for one whole year of playing is enough at least fix some bugs or improve some aspects
3,edited first review might be too emotional love the games gameplay and music there are non event activities you can do to pass the time eg do music hangout at a sims house hide and seek events come by at least once or twice a week though cannot still say much more about the games anniversary games lore is very interesting though the latest chapter is a bit lacking of sense there are also posts that are still not implemented distributed eg wings from the event from a fast food chain switch version of the game
3,visually stunning game and amazing soundtracks however most of the aspects of the game namely the domains relies heavily on rng which is quite frustrating the current pace for which the main story progresses is also slow the resin system whilst a normal feature in gacha games is severely limiting in genshin you can use up a days worth of resins in less than ten minutes but the greatest downside of this game is the way the company handles rewards and compensations which is lackluster
3,i have been playing since launch and have faithfully played until i hit the burnout wall for a couple months before archipelago update i have spent way more than i like to think on this game andi am not terribly proud of that ultimately this is a decent good game great art amazing visuals fun but the greediness from the gacha rates the resin system the artifact rng its sucking the life out of the player base add in the lack of endgame content and the lack of rewards and its a disaster
3,i mean the skeleton of the game is good solid gameplay good story exploration but then there is the really bad systems like resin gacha in general artifacts which makes the game just way less fun to play additionally the rewards in the game are not the best to say the least
3,late game makes you wish the company was not so stingy voice acting is good quality in every language runs okay on a galaxy but is better on pc albeit with locked fps characters are cool cutscenes are extravagant graphics are amazing exploration is a blast and grinding is fun it is a shame about the greed and the lack of rewards
3,repetitive after you finish all the current story updates but inbetween updates you can farm primo to save for new characters story and characters are great but wish we could somehow breeze through the time consuming non important daily commissions i between updates also wish there was an easier way to keep track of your wishes like a counter or something in the banner pages so we can easily see when we get our guaranteed five star
3,i really wish i could give this game a five star rating the open world is phenomenal and fun to explore as someone who is now in the late gamei am trying to entertain myself with photo taking of the beautiful scenery etc however ever since the two update things have really gone downhill the english stream for the two one update was delayed by one and a half hours characters have been released despite having seemingly unfinished kits and now the anniversary rewards mihoyo listen to the fans
3,overall the game is already good but the mechanics sucks please consider removing or decreasing the amount of resin needed for artifacts since it is one of the highest resin consumer on the game the artifacts system is based purely on luck to get the artifacts needed with good stats and sub stats please also consider changing the daily commission the rewards should differ based on difficulty ten for the easy and for hard commisions it may be randomized or fixed so its more rewarding
3,genshin impact is a great adventure without an entry barrier exploration is similar to breath of the wild collecting climbing gliding however combat is a fluid dance b w managing your partys abilities and chaining attacks the characters are all distinct with unique personalities the story filled with beautiful cutscenes lore and voice acting a visually impressive game edit decreased score due to low gacha rates and freemium currency i have hit soft hard pity for over half a year
3,i have played this game since release and i loved it exploration of a beautiful world amazing characters interesting lore but afteryou are done exploring and finished the quests there is nothing late game is a never ending grinding hell and that is it there is nothing left to do they keep releasing characters worth hundreds of euro or months of grinding and saving full of problems that they will not even address the story does not make any sense anymore the devs do not care and it shows
3,it was really exciting at first but now the storylines and characters are getting too boring the new events are not unique nor enjoyable once you reach a certain adventure rank the game becomes boring and repetitive it is getting very obvious that the games focus is on getting new players and does not care about its old players
3,it is been almost one year since i started playing this but i rate it three stars because of a issue in the game my device is redmi note seven pro and runs perfectly fine in medium graphics however when i enter my serenitea pot the game freezes after two second of entering so i have to close the game and restart again from the long process of loading screens sometimes it also freezes when i try to interact with something within the pot please fix this problem then i will reconsider the rating
3,while the game itself is amazing this game is not meant to be played on mobile its highly optimized but there is still a lot of lag tabbing out of the app will cause you to relog into the game with an insanely long load time this app should only be used for story dialogue or character enhancement anything where lag would not matter
3,when this game came out it was extremely good and i would have probably given it five stars but i wanted some time to chew on it exploration the world and core gameplay are all satisfying and fun characters are well designed and lots of cool secrets and clever things hidden for you to find my issues the materials in the game are cumbersome to get since weapons characters and equipment all need materials to level the gatcha rates pity or not are very very low steep power curve
3,so i really love this game i even have it on my pc but for some reason it is not going past the loading point here since my pc is gone for repair playing from phone was one of my remaining options left but this is and i say highly annoying because the first time i actually downloaded it it glitched the heck out of my photo gallery and after several re downloads it is not getting past this point fixing of this issue as soon as possible would be highly appreciated
3,i really like this game the graphics music characters and gameplay are all fantastic but for me personally i find that i cannot play it without a controller on my android phone unfortunately they have not added support for android controllers and show no signs they ever will this has prevented me from playing any further whenever controller support is added though i will come back to play and update my review appropriately
3,i really like the game but it does not run nearly smooth even in the lowest settings on my gigabyte ram phone not just that it is extremely difficult to catch butterflies lizards fireflies or the crystal core flies they are really hard to catch most of the time even if i am standing closer than cm to these things i cannot catch then because the option does not show and it really ruins the mood please fix these things these problems really ruin the whole experience
3,really love the game and it is concept however i cannot even enjoy the game specially it is graphics to the fullest the moment the stormterror appeared my game suddenly glitched and cannot see anything but bluish and some random colors on the screen you should try to fix this and optimize the game for a better gaming experience for all my phone even met the games conditions but somehow the game becomes glitchy during cutscenes please optimize the game furthermore really want to play this
3,pretty good game cute characters and story lines just wosh we could move while using our weapons or magic help with dodging more the game constantly losses connection specially during a mission which causes you to have to do it all over again and the game eats the phone battery life way too quick
3,the game great and all but i have two issues one you cannot switch server without losing your save data so could you add data transfer between two servers make it like once every two weeks or month that you can transfer server two there has been an awful amount of lag lately even if running on high end device on the lowest possible graphic settings the game jitters while loading stuff it is fine tillyou are just trying to explore but in combat or while flying late responses are fatal
3,a very good game but it is too bad that the only way of progress lays behind the gacha nothing to really do after a certain amount of time if you hope for a game to grind out without paying not your option at all you cannot get far without paying money because chances of getting the good chars are really low and collecting chars is the only real option of progress here as was said before
3,game itself is ok mechanics are essentially from botw where i do miss the fighting mechanics all the fun things like throwing bombs enemies will pick up etc have been replaced with simple mechanics where you just press the attack buttons till the enemies are dead there is loads of stuff to do and it is free to play game is not very well optimized on modern flagship phones there is no performance difference in highest and lowest graphic settings the game stutter and lags constantly
3,overall a pretty good game the graphics are amazing character gameplay is decent storyline is interesting but the pity system needs improvement and it also lacks endgame content most importantly though please add fa system pretty disappointed they have not added it by now considering the amount of players getting hacked every day
3,hello the game constantly crashes every ten minute less or more my phone is mid range vivo y and it can handle genshin but even though i am just running or walking and my phone is not that hot it still crashes and i see a lot of people experience this after the update please fix this if there is something wrong in the game and can you please at least optimize the game for some low end phone thank you hope this issue will be addressed
3,i love this game honestly the art is beautiful and it has many storylines the biggest downside is it had so many freezed up moments like i can barely play the game smoothly without it lagging up like it would work fine for a bit after i start it but then it just does not work later at all i cannot even report it because of that
3,genshin impact is a great game although there is an serious issue with the sound and alot of static gets sent through the phone not to mention the cutscenes tend to freeze half the time which tends to ruin the experience somewhat i would love it if you could fix these issues as soon as possible edit now the game keeps crashing every time i try to play it i would greatly appreciate if you could fix the issue
3,do not get me wrong the game is great and all but the problem is the crashing and lagging also the character switching whenever i need to switch character it would most of the time lag and take minutes for it to even work also recently my game has been crashing wheni am playing this has happen multiple times now the game is also laggy itself it would freeze as i am in a fight etc and i would sometime have to even turn my phone on and off for it to work please fix this
3,a great experience whose potential is crippled by the lack of controller support every platform but android now supports controller input and sorry to say that makes it the weakest way to play say what you want touch controls are awkward and unsatisfying the fact that this version of the game still relies solely on them is the one thing keeping me from playing this more
3,the game keeps crashing and crashing everytime when the story part comes all i see is black and when i play it keeps on lagging and it is not smooth i cannot play well and did not see what happened in the story it will only appear when the story is over i like the game the graphics the voice over characters and etc but i just cannot play when it keeps on crashing
3,well to be honest in terms of graphic this game is superb i mean console level graphic on mobile phone but a gamer not only wants that but a story that engage them the story is slow the character level up process is dreadful the fights are repetitive and boring after some point it is like they have showed everything enemy character way to soon and in terms of engagement they are introducing boring events in place of the actual story and the other regions i am slowly drifting away
3,i fell in love with this game the first few feews after i started playing it is amazing but after a while it gets repetetive after you get to adventure rank and above there is not much to do you repeat everything from defeating bosses to farming for items there is just not much to do i already quit and uninstalled it on my phone but it is still downloaded in my computer and i might consider going back if mihoyo fixes this and makes it so that you do not get bored easily
3,after reaching rank it tends to get too repetitive especially if you have completed majority of the quests i get to lose interest on the games since you do not have much quests to do primo are hard to come by new characters are harder to get hope you guys make the game more interesting
3,for starters game is great love the new contents however whats not great is that the game lags horribly even on the lowest settings after the one four update be it in combat or just simply wandering around green to yellow ping but lags horribly did not encounter this on previous version hope that the dev team can fix this issue asap lag joy kill
3,the game for pc at least it is great and i enjoy playing it a lot but there are problems with the performances note nine is heating so fast that sometimes appears that it is charging my phone and the audio problem on samsung is still not fixed if you do not use the record function you will hear a lot of cracked sounds i would recommend the game but not on mobile devices i only open the mobile app when i forgot to do some small tasks
3,gameplay is five stars but buggy as hell on mobile randomly freezes or closes entirely sometimes screen glitches out and calibration for archery etc goes out the window my phone is only a couple of months old samsung galaxy a and has plenty of free memory disappointing as the game is really good but issues make it unplayable needs fixing asap
3,i loved this game really much but for a while it starts to crash on my phone and tablet i cannot even go into the actual game because on the phone it just freezes and does not move after and on the tablet you can get to the door and after that it kicks you out of the game i thought it was just a bug but after deinstalling and reinstalling it still had the same consequence but the game is awesome and the graphics and sound is spectacular
3,awesome online rpg great story great characters and character progression excellent fighting system and mechanics this is the best you will find in the genre on a mobile device why only three stars no native android controller support i have this game on my device but i refuse to play it for this reason on my pc yes why controller support but until they introduce full controller support on android this game is just barely above meh on the mobile front
3,i installed the game about a week ago and i was having a lot of fun despite some lag however with the pre installed one four version the game is just too heavy and will not even get past the loading screen upon starting the game i have tried everything i know to try and troubleshoot the issue but it still crashes before getting to play it on mobile i do not have windows so this is kind of disappointing
3,this game is fun but i have some issues one the gifts some of the gifts is pretty good some others are questionable for example giving mora what am i going to do with that not only that i think that increasing the rate for wish could help the joy of the game when playing on the phone the camera angles keeps going down where all i can see it the ground please fix the camera angles
3,good game cheesy at times but tolerable three stars becausei am stuck trying to light some alters but it is not working and it is a main quest i cannot get done because of it so i have concluded it is a bug but trying to contact the devs is a pita so i gave up after wasting minutes
3,amazing game just gets very repetitive after about a month pretty much have to either spend money or quit cos the wish system is on about three chance to get a new character even after getting any new character you have to further spend more money to level up or grind the same dull thing over and over again gets incredibly dull after about adventure rank but deffo worth playing for the experience
3,i enjoyed the game but there are some audio problems on my pixel a also i joined the game to play multiplayer buti am level and do not see any sign of that the only other thing is i wish cooking was more challenging and i could toggle between automatic and manual after perfecting a dish great game otherwise
3,good basic game idea terrible execution enemies can juggle stun lock and basically destroy you at any level if they choose dodging works sometimes ifyou are exact on the timing also a lot of the game is about choosing the right elements for a battle you cannot do that with a lot of battles because enemies appear around you and you have no time to alter your team a lot of enemies just turn in to a chore just keep slapping them for an hour until they die totally boring game after adventure rank
3,well overall the game is great that only thing that actually stopped me from giving a five star rating is that the game always crashes nowi am scared to open the game again thinking that something bad might happen to my phone if i continue playing genshin i really loved the game interesting story and exciting adventures but the crash issue stops me from fully enjoying the game hope it can be fixed soon so i can continue playing again
3,very satisfying for a free game you cannot get more from free game more than this game lot of treasure unlimited bag to collect item all arond the vast world and so much more never regret it after installed really good job for mihoyo really recommended even though some part can be improve but really satisfying two five before but whenever i open bag or any setup interface my game became so laggy the frame rate drop like it gonna crash please fix this then i will rate five again
3,it is a great game i play it a lot it is really fun but it keeps crashing or freezing sometimes i play cooperative and suddenly i cannot move anymore and my character dies in combat or i cannot use the chat so i cannot talk to my teammate anymore or sometimes in singleplayer it freezes and i cannot do anything it does not even pass with time i have to close and then reopen it seeing how long it takes to open the game that is a problem and it happens all the time so annoying fix this
3,please do something about the game file size soon enough in future updates it will not be playable in outdated devices like phones and pc maybe an option to clear game files that is not needed anymore such as cutscenes on quests you have finished as will not be seeing them anymore its a good game but its too heavy and demands a lot of storage lots of crashes and stuck on loading screens due to devices unable to handle it a lot of people experienced it listen to the community thanks
3,the game is good problems are the resins takes too long to regenerate biggest problem is that the game takes too much memory space for android users the recent update made it gigabyte if this keeps up i might need to leave the game coz of the need for too much memory please lessen the memory needed for the game
3,i really like this game the graphics are amazing and truly a grinding game the only reasons i have for giving it three stars is because it drains battery super quick and my device overheats after like minutes the game can also can lag really badly when walking or even in combat and it is nearly impossible to get good characters unless you buy from this game which infuriates me to no end
3,when this app was released i really enjoy the graphics and the soundtracks but what really bugs me the most is the graphics after genshin impact was updated the graphics have started lagging and messing with my rhythm and my mind a lot even though my internet connection is ms or below
3,overall this game is ok biggest problem for me is the controls this game does not give you any joystick options and the fixed joystick is too low it makes combat difficult cause it limits mobility when you cannot go toward the camera easily it is also hard to turn the character because the character switch user interface is right where your other hand naturally lands to move the camera angle i also wish the camera default was angled a little higher because bushes and grass make it really hard to see
3,laggy i think that since the game is available for my phone it should be able to run even putting the graphics on the lowest and clearing storage it still does not run nicely the game then lags when jumping and fighting which is something you do a lot in genshin terribly disappointed i guess i will have to wait for it to come out on the switch and who knows when thatll be
3,i will not rate it less than a three star only because it is a great game reason why i changed it from a five star down to a three star is because whatever you developers did for the update it affected the performance on mobile i have well over the requirements for this game and it lags horribly in some situations please look into the optimization for mobile devices
3,this is a very good game it has an interesting plot line the graphics are beautiful and the voice acting is not mediocre the only major thing that really makes or breaks a game for me is whether or not there is a lag and unfortunately i am experiencing a major lag which is why i only gave it three stars i understand that this is a big game that takes up a lot of data and storage but if the lag was somehow removed this game would be a lot more enjoyable
3,its a very fun and well made game i have not been playing for very long but am enjoying it so far the design is beautiful it feels close to how i would think sao would feel look sound it does get two stars off because unfortunately the sound has started lagging and playing over itself making it very hard to listen to hopefully this gets fixed soon as it is an otherwise wonderful game
3,this is a really great game unfortunately for me i started it on console i made tons of progress but now i do not have free access to my console and there is no way to carry my progress from console to mobile which is absurdly disheartening seeing as i had a few limited five stars that are gone now i will play on mobile but the lack of cross save between the versions is why my score is the way it is also for mobile the option to rearrange the button layout would be nice
3,hi i just wanna say that this an amazing game and experience is top notch there is one problem thou after the last update the game had become so laggy on my phone it used to run smoothly on my redmi note but now even at lowest settings the game still lags a lot and switching between characters really has delays which is a nightmare especially when facing bosses at crucial times i rated the graphics five star and gameplay four but the controls and the way it runs really ruin the fun please fix
3,i have enjoyed the game for the past two months the only problem i have is after the one two update my phone heats up in my settings at the one patch i was forced to lower my settings even more and my phone still heats up whether the setting is smooth or balanced this is slowly turning unplayable into mobile i have a laptop where i can start playing the game but not everyone has the resources to get a backup device pc to play the game please make it more compatible to mobile
3,amazing game but mobile not so much first the camera will get in your way you have to focus on zooming out majority of the time during fights because the camera settings which you have no real control over constantly force you to zoom in which nine ten you do not want to happen secondly picking up items is a chore as compared to pc and console the prompt to pick up items does not pop up instantly like it does on pc or console it would make more sense if you just instantly picked up items
3,on my phone it was really glitchy and constantly freezing once you pass the first few levels you have gotta grind for a long time just to open the dungeons and quests but the graphics are amazing and the concept is cool i would be interested in playing it as a console game for a faster pace and smoother game play
3,game is amazing at first but the more you play spend the worse it gets they have a lot of security and balance issues at the moment which is making many of the player base weary of playing the game and many unwilling to spend and communication on these issues have been poor or poorly received game currently has a lot of progression strain on their stamina system resin specifically mora gold and hero xp getting a new hero takes two weeks of grinding to get them at a playable place then you need to spend even longer farming gear this leaves you at a place of always needing to farm for the future but the game is still great at it is base you can do everything but their end game three tower stages that reset bi monthly you can do those stages but will require a lot of careful investment it is a solid hours of content more if you do not rush through it until the security issues are fixed i would think before spending money otherwise give it a shot for a while but keep tabs on the communities of the game reddit is a good one but can be an echo chamber at times until at the least the security issues are fixed i cannot justify more than three stars and i only stand with that because of how much enjoyment the games world has given me since launch
3,genshin impact is really fun in the early game the ability to explore the huge landscape is pretty unrivaled for a free game that even runs on mobile but in the end the monetization lets it down if you can stop yourself from caring about getting new characters then genshin can be fun for a long time until you get into the late game where things become quite the grind but if you start to look forward to rolling for characters and if you want one in particular you will be disappointed
3,controls could be smoother and characters could definitely be a little more balanced but my biggest gripe and only reason i took stars off is my daughter really enjoys this game but has a hard time on some missions but i cannot cooperative with her for missions because appare notly having that option would be detrimental somehow to the people who do not want to use it edit i now have to add that i like the story but i just really do not enjoy playing solo i crave a good story cooperative game
3,i could not believe that a mobile game could be vast in terms of exploration npcs gameplay action story and lorei am enjoying it so far no problem running on my phone exynos note ten lite edit after playing since istallation for weeks now the self environmental damage for pyro and electro characters are just ridiculous even after update one not much difference adjusting camera angles during combat is sometimes annoying i just hope they would have options to use external controller
3,the game has potential but it lacks many things like events with rewards also the resin system seems to be a bit odd that you need full hrs to fill it up which is for the free to play side gates them pretty hard everyone in the game wants to be strong do you guus think players will go away if they get strong i do not think so i think more players will come if it was like that thank you for the wonderful game i hope you all to get this game up and better
3,graphic is nice and love the storyline play the game with pc using keyboard and mouse for better gaming experience game is not phone friendly as buttons keep getting in the way especially when you are on archer mode updates reaching gigabyte again not mobile phone friendly another note perhaps add sit function for quick hp recovery shortcut function to switch party also if mobs can interrupt attacks then players should too
3,the game is one of the best mobile game and one of the best free to play games i have ever played but there are a few issues one the gacha system is very unfair for free to play players low spending players a guaranteed five star item for pulls is way too much considering that the items are random and could be a duplicate item and you can only farm around primo a month which will only give less than pulls two the resin system takes too long to refill i e eight minutes for one resin
3,the game is very good the story line is great the graphics are pleasing too but after playing it for a week the game stated lagging very badly the user interface becomes unresponsive the fps drops to zero as the game becomes still all the other graphic intensive game seem to work just fine with medium to high graphics settings on my oneplus t so uninstallating for now
3,i really loved the game it has to be the best open world game i have ever played in my life graphics story everything is just overwhelmingly well done unfortunately there is one big disappointment you do not really get to play with others and this evolves more into a single player game the multiplayer is almost completely left out which i personally find super disappointing and means the two missing stars from me apart from that i can only recommend it to everyone
3,for a casual free two play game it is the best game handheld device could offer but for a gacha game this is way worse than what you would expect everythings gated yes but that is not the worst part involvement of credit card is necessary to allow advancement in many many things sure do play this game however do not go too deep it will cost you way more than you can imagine
3,game is great amazing story but the controls are atrocious and a small glitch messed up my entire game which made me have to reinstall again and we all know how painfully slow that process is apperantly there were more options put in for camera controls but that did not help at all the camera pans into the grass and i cannot see a single thing during combat half the time and it pans in every direction that i do not need it to be in swapping characters is equally as difficult
3,alright soi am absolutely fascinated with the game great graphics awesome map story characters and enemies but dang killing boss monsters for only character exp no adventure rank exp and can only get loot by spending daily resine kinda a bummer to me i hope for change during the next update for our adventures to be more fruitful then exp for a boss mob then there is the shop price its basically five bucks a summon then the controller support kinda needed for this game
3,super beautiful game but the story is extremely bland and at times simply does not make sense if they fixed that up then i would give it five stars but as is it lacked enough plot to keep my interest past about an hour into the game the graphics are phenomenal for a phone though controls are a bit tough
3,it is a good game overall other then the resin wall which restricts too many things and in update one they are gonna increase the max resin capacity to which does not change anything because the regen rate is still the same the drop rates for the five star characters are too low at six only i have opened wishes and the only new character i got was fischl and xingqiu i drew like x or four star weapons out of boxesi am getting bored because there is nothing pushing me to play
3,graphics on par gameplay is a i can sense that the game was not made for a mobile device the camera angle positioning when walking running jumping crouching climbing and gliding is awkward and i am having a hard time finishing the question fix the camera positioning have an option to autolock it where the character is facing
3,the graphics is unquestionably in a whole new level and the character is designed well so that the developer can a attract a group of people anyway my question is why would i have to stand besides a statue to recover my health and why is literally everything related to statue you could have made a method to recover health by drinking potion or by some sort of element which the player can carry all the time and to be honest this gameplay reminds me of pagan culture which is totally unnecessary
3,it is a beautiful game but the lack of controller support is inexcusable this type of open world game needs a controller to make it fully playable and enjoyable android fully supports both bluetooth and usb game controllers and there are even specialist controllers like the razer kishi specifically for mobile devices touchscreen controls which are actually done reasonably well here cannot ever rise to the level of a proper controller
3,the story and gameplay is exceptional everything about the game is great but one problem is the fps optimization the graphics limits people from playing the game the game requires high end smartphones i hope that there would be an update which will make this game open to a lot more players who has mid range phones
3,the game is amazing the story the characters and the missions but the main problem that i faced is that it takes time to load the game and while playing random crash occur i recommend the developers to fix the random crash problem and loading time
3,great game but for now i will give it a three star if ever you would consider adjusting everything for us android users that is only on mid tier phones then that would be very much appreciated i have a vivo phone with gigabyte ram but still it crashes the game every two minutes please do something about it if there is still a way not many players have decent phone to play this game which is a total bummer i will gladly spend money on this game if you could do something about this ty
3,i have this on pc but sadly the app is kinda too high spec always crashing after a few minutes into the game so had to uninstall i will just play on pc only then eventhough on pc it kinda crash too from time to time it only crash when i open map though so it is kinda a gamble everytime i open the map because it could lead to crash but good thing the loading is kinda fast so it did not bother me that much
3,it is a beautiful game with an interesting and fun combat system engaging characters and who does not love open world exploration however the pull rates are atrocious mihoyo is possibly the stingiest with currency still cannot get the character i want on mobile the camera constantly readjusts and zooms in which is annoying it is also incredibly hard to play on mobile on pc it is impossible to remap the control keys and strafe is not where it should be good game a little clunky to play
3,the game is beautiful and i love it on pc but when it comes to being on the phone the game is so laggy and unplayable at some points due to framerate drop and freezing even on the lowest settings for smoother game play the game still kinda sucks as you cannot take two steps anywhere without lag really do love the game though
3,it is a very pretty and polished game the world is vast and everything about the artstyle graphics music and lore is just wonderful however there is a point around hour into the game where the resin rechargable energy system begins to limit your gameplay after you expłore everything there is to explore you can just log in for minutes daily and there is nothing more to do because you do not have enough resin everything meaningful at this point costs resin and even if you pay its limited
3,while the game was good and a botw clone you cannot deny it it was a pretty interesting adventure to go on for a bit unfortunately it was not so good to me the controls are not customizable on pc and trying to do aim mode on android was not great controls made it difficult to play in full and the story feels off the voice acting is pretty good in english shout out to the english voice actor putting that aside there is not a real drive for me to continue to play
3,i am really enjoying the game so far but there are a couple things i do not like the wish rates for the five star characters and way too low it feels bad not getting good characters after saving up your gems for wishes the other thing that i do not like is the resin system i hope changes to regen rates get increased drastically in the future the boss fights and dungeons are some of the most fun you have in the game but they are locked to resin so you can only run them three or four times a day why
3,almost great the game is amazing however the resin energy system holds back players tremendously when they get to higher levels and want to continue the game without spending money i understand this is the case with multiple gatcha games but this game has so much content and does so many things right that having something so simple as a lousy energy system giving you at the most minute of fun daily unlessyou are ok with opening your wallet kinda sucks
3,the game is really good and it has a good storyline the only problem is that when i launch the game it is completely black for around ten minutes and i can only hear static noises while it is clearly supposed to be dialogue if you could fix this this game would definitely be a five stars game for me
3,great game at first but once all the one time treasure events secrets puzles are found the gameplay loop is mediocre energy system needs a lot of work needs more repeatable activities and rewarding events outside of exploring the reward system is lackluster and sparce compared to other gacha games especially since this is multi platform i hope with future content they can address these issues i did enjoy it up to now so its three five with the potential to be five five in the future
3,the game seems decent but i will not try playing it on my phone anymore fighting even the most basic enemies is nearly impossible because of some sort of lag probably mostly to do with my phone being unable to handle the extreme programming involved in the game i do not want to try fighting a boss like that ifi am going to play game i prefer a smooth experience
3,the game is awesome but that is not the problem here i cannot play it even for five minutes my gigabyte ram cannot handle this it takes about ten minutes to load and it lags a lot i wanted to play this forever but since the performance is bad i am planning to uninstall it if the problem does not get solved outi am currently playing on my pc so i know the game is great and all but since i do not always stay in my home i will really love this to work please make a lite version of the game
3,if only you could use a joypad and there was no lootbox bullshit fun game for the first few hours you will get stuck for bad controls and or not getting the right characters from lootboxes it is a shame since fight mechanics are pretty interesting and the story is kinda engaging art looks really good for a mobile game too it does get repetitive but wth it is a open world rpg every software house will add some mad grinding to keep you going
3,i really enjoy the pc version but the mobile version is awkward as hell to play chaotic action games like this are not suited to touchscreen controls i almost died several times in places that i normally would not have any problems with on a controller or keyboard the camera also tends to get stuck in grass for some reason making it difficult to see whatyou are even doing the mobile version just feels like an afterthought
3,this game is so beautiful the environments are gorgeous the verticality is amazing hidden secrets puzles rock paper scissors like elemental combat with combos good story but why three stars it is because the game feels empty not in the sense that there is nothing to explore in this vast open world it is because the game itself does not go beyond expectations of being an rpg the main aspect of grind in an rpg is the loot but here the loot is very limited and feels very restrictive as when you are done with the main story and the grind kicks in you will just get the same loot over and over again you could see a hidden chest in an obscure area but you will not expect anything rare in it you will just get a bunch of refine materials every time there is no sense of wow i got this really rare item in the chest it looks like a good pc game with cross play but after a while you will see that it is only a mobile game after all that is playable on pc
3,great game on pc not so much on mobile i have a moto giga stylist phone and it can run a lot of demanding games but for some reason not this one even on the lowest graphic settings it would be great if it was better optimized because i would love to play this on the go rather than only ever having to play it on pc
3,near perfect but on an older phone it lags a little bit when trying to pick up items so when trying to grab items like frogs butterflies lizard tails it is impossible soi am currently stuck on some quests just because i cannot pick items up which is super disappointing
3,so far i really like the game the graphics and game play are awesome my only wish that was different was that there were more characters especially guys more loot like weapons and gear and that the multiplayer was a little lower of a level to access and better game play like being able to have all of you get loot and experience
3,i have mix felling about this game the story is well done but this does not stop the game from having cons the game have your standard mobile energy which you have x amount to use to farm mats the problem with this is it limited you from enjoy some part of the game when you actually want to run does activity there are better alternative type of system the biggest problem the way the game designed for progression
3,real great game i am loving it buy there is no controller support for android is not on ps and pc kind of disappointed to be honest it would make the game way more playable one last thing the username and email is partially displayed when on launcher but phone number fully display when linked not really ideal when want to be same and want to stream in the same time
3,overrated quests and combat play similarly to many other mobile mmorpgs go to point a to kill x no of monsters go to point b to talk to npc go to point constellationto click on an object for a cutscene except it is not mmo apart from being able to climb most structures which is heavily inspired cough ripped coughed by zelda botw there is not anything note worthy also the gacha rates are ridiculous with six for five star chars when other gacha games average at seven for their highest rank draws
3,there is some problems with the game in my opinion it has a bug in the game where the faces of all characters just somehow disappear and it makes it very infuriating to play and sometimes in fights you cannot even see the enemy and you cannot attack the boss directly so i think it is ridiculous on how this actually works for everyone else
3,i know the game is in early access so there is bound to be bugs on the mobile version i have a samsung a and the game goes black for no reason and it lasts about two five seconds to go back to the game and it happens quite frequently but other than that the game graphics are amazing and game play is amazing
3,the story is great and all but i have not played half of it yet and now it keeps crashing i opened it and it was starting off nice but when i was about to do a quest it starts chrashing and exiting by itself i hope you can fix this problem i hope you can optimize for budget devices like mine i really want to play and enjoy this game like i enjoyed breath of the wild
3,this game was advertised to me as a mmorpg it is not i see that it is always online and the story style of it and gameplay is amazing cons thought are that t it lacks customization not an mmo and i have to switch between characters instead of creating one and sticking to it which for an mmo is kinda important but honestly if you spin it around to later on choose a class and stick with it you have hit gold
3,the game is a great game and all although i do have a problem with game crashing or closing on its own all of a sudden some said it is probably server problems but that does not seem to be the case because i know someone who is in the same server yet does not experience crashes i already fixed my game settings to smooth by lowering the graphics yet it still crashes someone i know can barely last five minutes in the game is there any way to fix this
3,i have the game on pc and it is a really fun game unfortunately the game is difficult for me to install on mobile when i go to download the game through the app it heats up my phone drastically to the point where it will eventually shut down also instead of the download picking up where it left off it starts all over again and if there is enough of the game already installed it thinks there is not enough room to install
3,great start but blinding i have gotten it on the ps and i really am enjoying it it is fun pretty and will probably be pretty addictive but it definitely needs some tweaks most importantly the ability to map my controls please let me decide what jump attack etc are on my controller second for the sake of my eyes i beg you get rid of the white loading screen or at least let me turn it off i am not exaggerating when i say that it is painful even with my lights on
3,this has been one of the best games i have ever played ever but at some point the game just starts to get stuck like i would log in and play for ten seconds and it will get stuck i would have to restart the app and it will just repeat the cycle of getting stuck after ten seconds of playing please fix this problem i have even deleted more than five apps and the problem still persists
3,this game is really good but the phone takes up way too much space and most phones can not even run it without kt being laggy or crashing not everyone can afford a expensive phone that can run all this game making this game lose a lot of players if there is a setting for players to have lower graphics this game is too advanced for most phones
3,the game is very good i love this game already but it needs a little bit of tweaking though especially optimization on androids specifically i am on the minimun req and put graphics on potato but still run into some issues e giga stutters game freezing game hangs too much cpu consumption i would change the rating if they would improve it
3,i love the game visually stunning great story but the controls omfderp the doggam controls so freaking frustrating seriously in the middle of a fight and you start climbing the fkn walls literally and i say fight you cannot focus on one specific enemy so of your time is spent trying to either find which direction it went in or again trying to drop yourself off the freaking wall or building yet again for the time this hour arrggh
3,the game itself is amazing a true show of what mobile is capable of however that is also where things get a bit complicated since it pushes your phone so hard i have found that my phone can get really hot during a gaming session and become uncomfortable to hold controller support would help alleviate this issue entirely please add controller support this addition would truly complete the experience for me and thousands of other players
3,well i can give it avg since i try it out cause people hype about it but control a bit hard to handle for mobile game i think it would be ok for console player or may be on pc but as i try it there no target lock with really hard on mobile when it is require fast place in the game second i think many people will get problem with the game cause it is require high spec of device to run it smoothly so you may have to buy new phone to play the game at least getcore phone eight gigabyte ram for this
3,gorgeous looking game but controls this game seriously needs controller support it is very difficult for me to constantly touch the screen and block my view of whatevers going on if you can get it to work with controls on the console and pc versions i do not see why this cannot work on android i probably will not be playing this version until that is fixed
3,i have barely been able to play but i love what i have seen so far my biggest issue is with the really low frame rate my phone meets the recommended system requirements but the game is only playing at ten fps even at the lowest graphic settings the visuals and small amount of gameplay i have tried are amazing but i will not be playing this game much at all until it has been optimized further phone pixel three os android cpu qualcomm snapdragon two ghz ram gigabyte
3,i was hyped up for so long until i played it and the game runs smooth at the beginning but cutscenes sure do love freezing or not even showing i admit it sure is laggy even with very low quality with my gigabyte ram snapdragon but even at lowest it is still laggy at some point and barely show cutscenes hey maybe your phone is better than mine but others are experiencing this too and it is no fun
3,i played for about an hour and got into the first city but then when the cutscene with the blue dragon came out the game froze so i tried force stop and reopen the game but the same thing happens does anyone else experience this really seems like a solid game if you can fix the crashes
3,game looks nice combat is fine wish the controls were customizable though the cutscene where the dragon appears in the city completely freezes my game and i am just stuck there i guess needs to be fixed edit the game froze visually and in audio during the cutscene so i did not get to see it game played as per normal afterwards
3,a game with lot of potential but all good has a bad the game is too large for most mobile devices the visuals freezes on me but the audio goes on so i cannot even play the game i am sure players will find more errors and mistakes and you will need to fix it you are the developers after all but in the end i shall give you a three star rating for your potential and the big mistakes i hope you will fix the errors and i wish you all have a good day
3,i am playing on an android phone and though the download time took about thirty minutes for me i felt that unlike most that was quite manageable however the chunks did not load in properly until my character entered it and hope that the graphics can be improved as it looked very scuffed this is because lighting in the game was too bright to the point that the ground was bright yellow this really ruins the gameplay and therefore i hope that you take this feedback into consideration thank you
4,on a plus side the games a great combination of xenoblade and botw on the bad side is that it is a combination of xenoblade and botw
4,this game is great but if its going to download it keeps telling me i do not have enough storage when i do and i deleted twenty plus gigabyte but still will not work please help
4,so i i have too do this archon quest and it have too do a quest but then when i was done it says too do it again and i need too fix it
4,it is amazing the graphics and everything but too much space
4,it is all good but does not have a pvp option on top of that it is a gacha game so it is very tough for the free to play players to keep up
4,from my experience it is a pretty good rpg game plus it is an open world rpg lastly the graphics are decent so il give it four star rating
4,i love the game the experience the exploration this game is like thirty gigabyte wish more combos just started game it is really fun i do not usually play animes to be honest
4,it is good so far but it keeps kicking me out i was in the middle of fighting and it kicked me out it is annoying but good game
4,best game combat open world exploration strategy adventure hidden stuff quizes and lots of great stuff but the storage after four update is thirty gigabyte we can understand that you do not wanna reduce quality but that at the sake of many many ppl not being able to play the game is not good either make some downloads a bit dynamic so that we will download that content only if we want to voice background stories and advance graphic files can be optional also make a deaddiction centre
4,i think it is the best game in android but when i still play it my mobile gets very hot
4,decent game i wish it was more optimized for lower end devices
4,i love the game play but the one thing you hate about the mobile version is that it take a lot of space and drain my phones battery
4,great game just need more stores and ability to buy stuff
4,really fun game but i always get nothing on the summons but it is still a good game nine over ten would recommend
4,i love the game but i still cannot figure out how to dive i want to be able to interact with friends more

4,i love it but when i got a new phone and installed it on that phone my old account kept crashing it works on a new account but i want to use my old account i do not know what to do i love the game the graphics are great the lore is great too
4,though it does take up a lot of data it is still a really fun and amazing game to play
4,good graphics but no as much as expected of that size eight gigabyte
4,this is awesome the graphics work for my device the games voice acting is good as well
4,well it is a very nice game but it takes five hour to download and it takes thirty giga of storage and it says three hundred minute of storage my grandmother phone even with zero storage she could not download it trust me
4,feels like a console rpg so far it is a lot of fun
4,imagine you come home from school stressed tired and depressed your dog just died because your family cannot pay the vet bill you log into genshin impact your favorite game ever to find solstice you manage to get to seventy five pity and can get a limited five star your favorite character you lose your to qiqi constellationyou cry because your life is helpless hopeless and depressing make at least my favourite game more forgiving i use this game to have fun to escape not be depressed let me run
4,could you please change it so if one already had the app can automatically sign in and begin to play if reinstalled please
4,this is an excellent game it is very fun to play this game but i do not like that i cannot get an five star out of the banner except diluc
4,even if it is not an mmo game it is still awesome though it is graphics in phones are not upto the mark but i am still loving the game and it is story
4,nice rpg and beautiful song also graphic but i cannot see a text damage and a grass so i think i just give it four stars
4,it is a nice game from graphics to style play is nice but please do not swich genshin impact for funtap
4,good game but a bit misleading on the games storage it is over over twenty gigabyte in size when downloaded
4,it is a really good game but the loading and updating process is really slow takes forever
4,just uninstall it and reinstall the game and is good love the game that is why i get annoyed if it is not work smoothly
4,yes the game has its issues but its better than most in this genre
4,i am new player in twenty twenty three i enjoy the game most but file data are so many it does not matter
4,i wished the pitty system was not so unforgiving and dialogue skip does not exist wich makes it worse

4,love the game but please for the love of barbirtos can we have the option of unlinking our account from our psn account withouth losing our progress also please make an option to block requests if wanted
4,pretty good game has definitely evolved over the years been playing yr and i all was come back to it
4,perfect but it needs tons of space to play on and it took up a lot of gigabyte so i had to delete it
4,the story is really great gameplay wise its eight over ten very repetitive if you are done with the story you have nothing else to do but farm
4,it is a really good game but it is annoying how it now censor words like can and me and the fact that you can cuss and it does not censor it but other than that it is cool can you please fix this
4,it is fun and interesting but recently i have had troubles logging into it
4,the best game i have ever played totally zero ads but it can be really laggy sometimes
4,it is good it plays fine the graphics are amazing but it makes my phone as hot as the sun
4,the game is very good but sometimes i have to change my account because sometimes my account can get very weird
4,i love the game and i highly recommend it however the file size is just too big to reasonably have on my phone it takes up nearly seventy
4,i lovee this game i have not missed a single day but the thing that bothers me is the storage that it takes i deleted so many apps to play it but it is still an amazing game
4,i have been playing this game for half an year pretty good graphic moderate game function cool characters
4,everythings gonna be good in this game but they need listen to gamers and add east languages like arabic
4,it is a good game but it takes forever to do a quest and once we finish it we barely get any primo
4,amazing game just that it does cause your phone to crash but i guess it depends on your phone love this game would give it four five stars if i could
4,it is a great game just does not fit in my phones storage space anymore since the four update
4,very good game cause addiction very not free to play friendly you have to spend alot alot of phone usage like storage and ram and processer causes overheating super quickly
4,wish we could get more primo in the grave period of time between regions coming out like you have explored all of fountaine and you are waiting for the next region but it is good good game
4,it is an amazing game worth five stars but i am giving you only four stars because this game does not support xbox controller on android but ios version does please make xbox controller usable for better gaming experience on android
4,i do not know why but game is not loading and it is full black and it is hang and there are so many buildings invincible it is not loading in the new region
4,i love the game but really wish they would optimize the android version or add something like controller support
4,the animation of the game is just amazing its story line is quite suspenseful which makes it even more interesting
4,the game is amazing but i have been trying to get in the game but it says i do not have enough storage after i cleaned out my junk files it still did not let me in
4,much better than i expected runs excellent on full graphics too samsung edge twenty twenty two
4,reduced one star because i need to remove a lot of apps just to update this and updating takes so long and my phone gets way to hot
4,this game is amazing the only thing that really bothers me is that the game crashes sometimes for seemingly no reason other than that it is pretty good
4,this might be the best game i ever played no game i have been experiencing so fun with many fitures but playing mobile is a pain when its really give a weight on your memory phone so its usually lagging and bugging a lot and many update that load really long if your phone take a bunch of your toll away
4,the graphics are amazing it is a good game the characters are great and the visuals too
4,there are a lot of mechanics behind all the actions you can take in this game if you start just focusing on what seems important you will have fun
4,this is a great game in everything but it has a problem when i launch the game it sometimes does not launch or launch super lagy
4,it is perfect games with art and gameplay cool but it not suitable with my phone when having phone performance is low
4,good but i got i problem every time i run an app and try to log in it says no network available internet connection is good what is going on
4,it is a good game overall and the new updates quality is breathtaking but i must say it is still a bit buggy
4,the game is so much fun almost perfectly but my problem is it is so hard to get a five star characters i hope you might like to adjust the rate
4,have not played in a while so i had to update it and now i can seem to get on my account all my characters gone what the hell i still have my uid i have sent a email to cs support to no avail
4,good game good graphics amazing storyline one downside is the storage space it goes from downloading it at four hundred fifty megabyte to twenty nine gigabyte fix this devs please
4,well it is a fun game i never played open world game before and the fontaine map it is cool the players can swim now
4,it is amazing game but the gifts in this game are bad i hope you can give us better rewards and make us get thirty wishes its better than twenty
4,four stars because the problem was the storage but the quality of the game is good but super laggy sometimes
4,i really like it maybe make it easier to get primo gems but overall is a great play it is addicting send help
4,good game fun game a lot to do on the game but it takes up to much space keep wanting me to update but does not free up not used space so not enough space to keep playing the game
4,i love to play this app on playstation but i cannot use it on my tablet even though i have the data to play this game but i love this game either way its really fun and helps pass the time
4,its good but my device cannot keep up for battery usage four thousand and six hundred mah for nearly six hours android eleven four gigabyte ram one hundred twenty eight gigabyte storage good sfx good japanese dub
4,this game is really fun it runs surprisingly well on mobile devices but i recommend using the lower settings for better ms and is legitimately beautiful in scenery the only issue with this game is that the storyline content is released slowly and over time which leaves not as much gameplay for higher leveled players the final game then will be a huge file difficult to run on mobile i reccomend but realize this game does take some commitment to get good and to finish
4,i would like to give this game four stars out of five it really has everything that most of us wanted to play characters having their individual stories beautiful visuals osts etc and i loved it the only problem that i have is that i get kicked out of the game everytime i try to login which is the only reason i gave four stars please do fix this matter asap
4,i had a great time while playing but the new updates reset my progress it is my fault since i did not log in yet but i am just a bit upset about it
4,ty for bringing forty five fps option to mobile i wonder when the developers add official gamepad or keyboard option to mobile if you guys did that it will be fun for us mobile player maximize the gameplay
4,well i just played genshin about four month and already takes nine gigabyte on my phone but overall the game is good i liked the storys and i liked the quests but sadly it tajes alot of memory
4,a free to play game an open world stunning graphics structures and places awesome characters and cool mechanics amazing archon and story quests i really enjoy this game the only problem is that you got lesser to do when you are already on late game adventure rank fifty five and above however as the game storage gets higher i cannot help it i already deleted my past game resources but still ending up with high storage in mobile i hope this can be addressed somehow
4,the game is nice the graphics are crack but the disappointing thing is the anniversary rewards there were no major eventful things they only gave us twenty wishes not anything else so that is very disappointing for free to play people
4,takes long to load but otherwise it was great very fun and a lot of details
4,i like this game so much but there is a bug where the damage ang elemental reaction do not show so please fix thisby the way i am in mobileand please the reduce storage consumption as much as possible thank you
4,quite fun the quests are super long and you do not earn much from them though i do not really like the whole wish system i hate the fact that i have to pull ten wishes in order to get only new character or if you are super super lucky but it really frustrates me out as there are many people that cannot pay to get as much primo as a beginner it is quite hard to earn primo so it is very hard for me to actually get a new character the quests do not usually give primo also
4,i wish i can give this a five star well because i just give this a four star five star because sometimes it always lagged and they always kill me even i am not doing anything but i love it that is all thank you
4,the best game i have ever played there is still a problem the game gets bigger and bigger and now it weights nine gigabyte please consider this issue
4,we need controller support for tablets i do not want to keep using third parties apps the game is alright been years playing and no controller support whatsoever
4,good but gradually it will be boring please add multiplayer fights like some battle royal game
4,good game very nice the characters are well designed but will not give me qiqi it is either i win the pity or get another character that is five star but no qiqi i demand a qiqi
4,this game is beautiful and the game is very fun and cool but the downloading recorces thing is annoying cause i have to wait for a really long time and it really frustrates me
4,i play on android it is pretty hard to play on android since every time i go to inazuma it kicks me out a takes a a while for me to re join but other than that it is a good game
4,my luck in gacha game is actually bad but the game is actually good and has a nice music and the world exploration which is really good
4,so far i love the game the only thing i do not love is the moving control it can become frustrating at times
4,i love this game it has so many different characters cool designs a great storyline but there are some problems for one this game takes up an insane amount of storage space the only other thing is i wish that you could swap between different teams more efficiently instead of going to the paimon menu and selecting party setup and switching it that way other than those issues the game is great i recommend downloading on pc or playstation playstation xbox because it runs smoother
4,i really like this game but i do not know why it keep on crashing i even reinstalled it times a week but nothing happens and due to this i am missing all the events
4,the best open world mobile game i have ever played the only problem i have faced is the visuals settings i tried playing in sixtyfps but my phone became too hot forty°c
4,good game and lore and all but i just met diluc and my game keeps freezing and i am so upset edit nvm i restarted my phone and it works again edit the game is too laggy to even begin to play
4,the storage space is not my problem but it still laggy in eight gigabyte phone in medium settings overall the story is so cool i would still recommend this
4,i love the game the characters the map and the lore i really do the update has made it rather insufferable playing it though there is a glitch that happens regardless of whether or not i uninstall restart the game midway battling say the oceanid it is hp is down to half all of a sudden the battle stops and disappears when i do a rebattle it becomes × difficulty wasted my items i still love the game though just hard to get resources to level up the characters when this happens
4,i really liked the game and all and i understand it is for the player but i really think that the resources and all takes too much space
4,graphics characters and game mechanics perfect but pulling a character is so hard and its so hard to earn primo gems
4,game going good so far and as a free to play player the third anniversary rewards are very good i just wish that the octobaby has more animations
4,fun to play but the game are is so demanding you need a high end phone to play these games smoothly but the game itself is great
4,people who star this game have a potato phone lol anyways good game the sucks i wish to skip cutscenes and dialogues the characters are muah
4,genshin impact is truly a breathtaking game with stunning views serene music and amazing characters with eye catching stories it truly is the best rpg game that i have played and enjoyed and hope to play in the long run until the end of the story the only thing that is an issue is the amount of storage space it takes now and i hope that the cloud feature becomes available for fps in my and many other countries as soon as possible
4,i like the game that relate to gods and this is perfect i like the characters the story the grapic of the game but if there is no story to do is the game will boring and that is my broblem so i rate it four stars
4,the game is gorgeous the map is expansive with beautiful variety the story is in depth characters are imaginative and the world building is impressive it is just really boring the grinding is excessive and time sensitive the combat is incredibly repetitive story boss fights and special events not withstanding even though i have played this game for years i eventually decided to delete it after i noticed it was constantly putting me to sleep
4,i have played this game for a year i enjoy it alot eksept for the amount of storage and the long loading to just login
4,i love the graphics of the game and i like the characters but the loading tales very long
4,they added a new region and some great quality of life upgrades we finials have proper maps
4,it is a very well planned lore exploration type game problem is takes way like way too much space on mobile unless you have two hundred sixty gigabyte or five hundred gigabyte there is no way you will be able to have this game before it is finished
4,i have been playing this game for three years now and i have never had an error until the fontaine update came i kept having a note that says game files verification error and it makes me redo the entire loading again five or six times which makes me lose a large amount of time while playing the game i have been trying to find a solution for this to stop once and for all but it keeps telling me the same notification everytime please fix this issue so i can play your game calm and at peace
4,i really like this game even though i do not like any others under hoyoverse and i have been playing on a new account after my last one was deleted it is super easy to get used to the controls but i still wish you could connect a keyboard or controller and still play on that also the rendering is very slow and it often disconnects me without warning
4,fun smooth creative gameplay with great characters the only downside is i am now addicted to gambling
4,the game was fun and i really enjoyed it the story is very fun and the amount of things you can do makes the game very engaging it does take a bit to load and takes up quite a bit of storage but it is worth it the characters all have their own designs and the game play is peak highly recommend
4,i love this game it is so beautiful and the chars are hot the quests are kinda long though
4,the game is great and all i have played it for a year and have not encountered any bugs so far the fontaine update is cool too i am loving the underwater exploration but i have a problem regarding the four update ever since i have updated the game when i open it it is always stuck in the loading game screen and no not the loading screen where you can see the vision elements symbol but the game screen you know that thing people thought is celestia or something and i do not know what to call it
4,this a very good game have astonishing graphics and cut scenes there is only issues i have this gets laggy and game developers please add a pvp mode as well that will be amazing
4,the most beautiful game i will ever find unfortunately i will give it a four stars because of the storage it is so big it crashes sometimes please make the data storage low so that people can play without any problems of storage
4,best game i have ever played on an android device only disadvantage is android version do not have a controller support
4,overall great game but you will pretty much ran out of content in a few days of playing and will be mindless farming and with the resin system that forces you to be able to farm them only a few times a day makes it harder to farm and the artifacts are rng on top of rng on top of rng so you really need high luck or absurd amount of resin to get a possible good piece
4,instead of spendings three hundred dollars and one thousand hours in this game you know what i could have done trying to get some girls and undepress myself but instead i chose big anime booba and more knowledge on how this game works then knowledge about my own family eight over ten would recommend to everyone who likes mildly dark fantasy stories surprisingly deep combat and a beautiful world to explore the puzles might mess you up if you are not smarter than a seven grader
4,the only game i play i have stopped playing all others my only point of concern is the enormous and ever growing app size it is insane mihoyo needs to do smthng to relieve the pressure of storage on mobile phone users
4,it is a great game but it takes too much storage from our gadget is there a way you could fix the storage issues not hating but it just takes too much storage it would not even download since i only have five gigabyte storage left even though i deleted all of my apps so i hope you could lessen the gigabyte that the game needs
4,it is a very good game for those who love anime and manga manhua but there is a network problem some time it is a bad side this game does lag on mobile player but it is not happened very time lastly i will say the game graphics is best
4,i will give genshin a four star its a good game if you do not have anything to do its a time consuming game but only if you have lots of storage if your on mobile your genshin probably will lag a bit or just put it on the lowest graphic as a genshin player that plays genshin over a year started on seven its a very time consuming game but only on the early gameplay it will become a boring game when you reached a high adventure rank like adventure rank fifty seven or so well if your adventure rank sixty you basically just wait for events
4,i love this game i love the storyline of it but i joined back once and i had to restart everything and i do not know why if you could help i would be very grateful edit i fixed it but i lost two of my characters and i cannot seem to get them back some help would be greatly appreciated
4,it is a good game but me and my cousin cannot really play it maybe because i just started but maybe you guys can fix it please i do not know what i am supposed to do or maybe it is because i have out of either way it is not letting me player or i am just do not know how to play because when they first shows up i just see like stairs maybe it is just logging in and taking a long time but i do not think so and then their circle and l click on it and this is to put my username and password
4,genshin impact is a good game at the start if you enjoy a good story along with decent awards it is really so so but late game is so horrible some people who max out everything complain about the free to play primo grind which is outrageous but unfortunately there are limited time events we can do for primo and future map exploration so if you want to start the game please keep in mind that it is not really free to play friendly if you do not like grinding the gameplay and characters are okay to be honest
4,i love this game the graphics the character everything but please add skip button for story and please put more effort in other than main quest add voices to the npc and character during quest lastly please make shenhe rerun banner
4,i absolutely love the game the visuals character designs gameplay all of it is great but one problem is that it takes over thirty gigabyte please find a way to fix this
4,this game being free is an absolute win the scenery and graphics are absolute the music is so hype and chilling the stories are chef kiss and the prizes on events are generous i just hope there is more late game contents for those player who are only waiting for the next story before every patch
4,good graphics and quality the story is amazing the attacks effects are just but there should be a skip quest for some unnecessary parts of quests that it the only thing i think this game lacks in my opinion
4,i have spent two years of my life in this game and it is sadly getting boring i am adventure rank fifty five now finished the latest archon quest and the other side quests except the cleansing sakura quest heck i am not doing it i just ask three things one consider increasing the resin cap like star rail two make more end game content and three make the limited weapons obtainable via paimons bargains gosh i need albedos weapon the time he is getting a rerun
4,ok iove the game just had to uninstall it due to the amount of space it took up does it have to take up so much space i think it was all ready over twenty gigabyte by the time i uninstalled it and i just cannot seem to get the hang of fighting also keep getting jumped by stronger enemies when exploring and dieing to them but overall the game is really good
4,edit twenty seven gigabyte now after four point zero update think before installing really nice game and graphics it does take significant amount of time initially but later stages gets really slow and you actually need to wait for game update to play more there is tons of stuff to explore but gets monotonous after some time it was one point five month for me update how big this game is going to be it is already more than twenty gigabyte now and cache will be more tired of this
4,i love the game but can you help me cause when i am diving at my asian server in fontaine unlocking a waypoint my game got crushed i tried to play it again after hours it just loaded for like four minute and when i tried to close it my phone is not responding now i am crying cause i got many goods characters at that server but i also have another server european but i only have jean as five star there i hope you can help me ty
4,it is overall a pretty good game but there are two things one it takes alot of space just to run the game in general i know its so the graphics are better and such i just feel it is abit excessive and second the ads the way they advertise the game in general is so just obnoxious and even abit annoying the game does not have ads in game i am just talking about the advertising of the game on other platforms overall great game
4,i have encountered a bug so when i log in to my main account after downloading the resources it lets me right however when i have not downloaded the resources to my other account it makes me download it and when i try to go back to my main account it makes me redownload the resources please fix it because i just want to log in fast thank you
4,this game is very amazing the new update is cool fontaine is also breathtaking and the underwater mechanics are amazing too but whenever i try to log in to play the geo icon takes so long to load please fix it
4,the game is extremely good i love playing it but there are some things i do not like resin the resin cap is sixty only and it takes eight minutes to get resin so it almost takes hours to recover fully you should increase the resin to two hundred and thirty or three hundred like you guys did it on honkai star rain primo every update we are gutting less primo you should give us more opportunity to get more primo besides daily commissions game content after reaching adventure rank it gets boring
4,perfect game and lovely cooperative but i wish we actually can switch servers but the same progress we had but make it like a while to download new resources to switch to a server and about the friends list one not sure but can we still have them in our list even if their different servers example my friend is europe server while i am asia server he can switch to europe to asia with the same progress he had with europe server also add an option of like want to make a new account
4,the game is very beautiful and everything in it is beautiful the characters and the maps but there is something i did not like which is why we cannot enter the game until after downloading megabyte and sometimes you must delete the game and download it again and download all of this again
4,i like the game the graphics and game play are great however it is very grinds and sometimes most of the time it feels like a a cash grab which most gacha are so that is fine i stopped playing a month after summeru because of how much gigabytes it took and i am reinstalling to see fontaine and i swear to god if fountains is behind an adventure rank level wall like inazuma i will uninstall and rate stars i still like the game
4,i really love this game i am almost years but now i cannot play it since the problem is the small storage space i am still suffering with my gigabyte phone and i suggest to give us at least an option of to delete past resources in the starting screen
4,the game is awesome and very beautiful and creative but whenever i am playing on my laptop paimon always says that i fell into abyss which i was in land and not near the barrier but overall it is a good awesome game but i cannot play please fix this hoyoverse i really want to keep playing this game
4,this is a very great game i made a lot of friends here and they are very trust worthy and i am already having fun but ever since the new update came i have been lagging so much and my game started to crash but hopefully it will fix soon
4,beautiful game ten over ten for me after playing every day for months i lost all my progress and the game sent me back to character selection i tried starting over but piamon voice started to get annoying so i removed the app
4,it is a really good game my only main issues are that if you join later than you have missed out on all the events like it is a massive fomo trap and i wish you could have like a way of getting the specified rewards that you cannot just get anywhere like the little seelies that follow you around i do not know what they are called and to make it free to play because not everyone can afford to spend money on games other than that i love the game
4,great update new battlepass weapons new artifact craftables new features the only remaining problem is let us top up on any device aside from the device that we created our account it will be a matter of time before my playstation break down i hate it when i have to open up my playstation and update for every new version just to buy battlepass there please let us top up on any device please
4,its a really amazing game though i am stuck on the loading screen i keep crashing on the loading screen on the element it logs all of the element but the geo one keeps coming back and leaving i do not know what to do but overall it is really good game and it is addicting to play
4,it is so very very fun to play graphics and everything although i wish you can play mission during cooperative mode so that we could have more fun playing with other players while helping them achieve their goals missions
4,this is a great game for the first week but after that there is just too much dialogue if i want to do anything i need to go through about five minutes of dialogue it is just not as fun anymore but other than that it is a really great game i would definitely recommend it if you are patient enough to suffer through the dialogue also constellationkequing is not funny
4,it is good to be honest but the thing i hate is the optimization overall it is good it is art style writing but yeah the graphics make it optimize even i am using a snapdragon sixeighty chipset and please please make the characters chance because so it does not really that expensive so i can save money for essential things that is all have a great day
4,game is good scenery storyline events and many things are pretty but now as fontaine update came my devices cannot seem to handle laggy game also fixing to reduce storage would be good for many players to join hoyoverse please fix laggy issues in fontaine it is terrible
4,it is actually a five star for me but i decided to give it only four since i was disappointed because it does not support controller for android it will be much better to play this game with the help of the controller regardless of what device but overall it is still a good game
4,the game itself is a lot of fun but the gatcha is predatory and not generous at all however it is pretty easy to ignore it and just have fun edit uses way too much storage have to uninstall
4,the gacha rate is terrible edit to be fair music and animations of this game are great however the gacha game companies really need to be transpare not about the rate if they want some credibility we really need a law to force the companies to open source their gacha systems edit but the game trailers are insanely good it deserves more stars
4,the game is good graphics are crisp though personally i wish i had the choice of what weapons my character can use no matter the class be it mage archer heavy swordsman or light swordsman
4,it is okay if you wanna play it but be wary of the gacha it can suck you dry like a succubus also hoyoverse still gotta fix somethings like resin and the artifact system at high level it is just too boring to play the game as new characters need at least decent artifacts to reach potential but the same are rng based and require resin to get which limits how much farming can be done for them so you reach a stage where you want to play new characters but it is too much work other than that it is ok
4,put it on xbox already it is hard to play on a small phone thus it is hard to play for a long time without getting irritated especially when the phone graphics go in and out
4,i have been trying to load into the game for over hours now and every time i try to start the game i have not even made it to the game yet it just says insufficient storage i have heard great things about it but i cannot even load in edit i got into the game on another device and it is amazing great graphics and storyline
4,i like that the world is pretty and full of chests and things to explore but the longer you play this game its getting more and more boring hoyoverse please add skip all dialogue option
4,overall it is a great game and the graphics are amazing but there is problem that whenever i open genshin on my tablet it crashes and it have not worked for about months please fix this problem
4,the game itself is great beautiful scenenery great artstyle amazing char and story as long as you consider it as a single player game for an online game this game is trash barely any pve and no pvp content which is fine by me for the pvp part and most of all the devs are not interested in your opinion or feedback they just do what they deem you want or need
4,the world building characters art design and game play are fantastic and among the best in the genre the gacha mechanics are a bit egregious unfortunately i understand the developers deserve to be appropriately compensated for making a game of this caliber but rolling for characters is kind of a nightmare due to insanely low drop rates that do interfere with my enjoyment of the game otherwise this is a five star experience
4,its a great game my favorite actually the only thing is that it fills up insane amounts of storage i cannot play it anymore because the space it fills has become too much and i cannot update it due to lack of storage
4,version is not installing tried to start it loaded for an hour i shut down the phone as it was heating up now i get an insufficient space notification while i have five gigabyte available on android phone i cannot play before updating either
4,the fontsine update pulled me back from almost quitting the game its amazing it is awesome to explore underwater this is the start i know but would be awesome if we can attack underwater with some other methods if not with the character skills anyways great work but i could not believe when i saw the update it was of gigabyte in pc same as that of the game size itself i mean really
4,i am giving it fours for now it is a really great game it keeps me occupied for hours but my only concern is it is lagging i do not know why though can you please fix it i hope you could read my concern thank you in advance by the way i hope you add log in rewards too much gigabyte i will be back to play again when i upgrade my phone i will miss you genshin i will be back wait for mee
4,it is a real fun game you can meet new characters and always find way to get rewarded the characters are amazing my only issues is that i wish there were more poc and that the game can stop crashing
4,absoloutly love the game its tons of fun and has a great story only issue with it for me at least is it takes up way too much storage for the mobile version so i will probably have to install it on my pc if i wanna keep playing
4,well this have to be the best game i have been playing it for years now my only issue is the storage my sixty four gigabytephone cannot handle all of this if i want to download everything that means that my phone would have less than five gigabyte for my other apps i barely could download my necessary stuff now this game means alot to me i for real want to play it until the endgame if there is any storage optimisations i could do or the game would fix it would be really good other than that everything is good
4,its a very good game and once you reach level six you can play with others the graphics are beautiful you cannot play without internet connection and takes alot of storage otherwise its a very good game
4,Very fun game I only wish for more freemogems The game updates frequently and it has plenty of events Update for being a game supported by players for three years we should be getting more then two over 9s of a five star and some extra things The other games by hoyoverse give a free five star and gacha games only do well with the support of the players Even if they do not give a free five star atleast give twenty more pulls even if it is for standard Because that will satisfy players more then zero pulls on limited
4,addicting as hell gameplay is stunning graphics are beautiful fplay but money helps wish there was more darker skinned characters and diversity takes a lot of space on your phone but somehow runs smoother than on my pc
4,love everything about the game the graphics storyline and characters are interesting and cool wish the game was not so big though it is taken up all of the my storage space
4,genshin is a fun app to play and all the problems that i got many years ago is already been fix its just the storage space of the game that bugs me that is why i rate it to a four instead of a five over all the gameplay and story is fun
4,it would be wrong to classify genshin impact as a mobile game has stunning graphics quality with environmental detail emphasizes on the gacha system a lot but there is not any need to spend money on the game however it is good as a side game or casual game not something you would play for hours
4,i love this but the only problem i have is that i am quite new to the game and i want to get cyno but to ascend him you need scarabs but i do not have the areas unlocked on the map so i cannot even see where the area is please make and easier way to get them for newer players
4,as much as i love this game the update is too much for my phone to handle so i am very upset because i currently only have apps facebook honkai star rail and genshin impact i absolutely do not want to delete star rail nor facebook but i still want to continue playing genshin i really do not know what else i can do to continue playing
4,i founds this game very enjoyable and barely any glitches however my only complaint is that it took way too long to download resources and data apart from that minor part everything else is really good
4,this game has the most awesome graphics if your device is bad running it on max graphics can overheat your phone and you will feel a laggy hoyoverse should do something with this but in the end the coolest game i have ever played is genshin
4,i personally love this game but the thing is that they did not care about low adventure rank players forty five below the new event is good but the mini games you play is annoying who tf can kill sixty enemies with just two and a half minutes tf the fact that they added literal abyss in the event also you do not get to have anyone to help like five star trial or something and the buff expire fast ghurl i kill twenty two enimies in just two and a half minutes not even thirty or forty twenty two god
4,it has good characters and pretty epic story but i think resin cap should be higher since it is getting added to star rail too cooperative experience is not great but i guess it is ok it is a good game you can choose whether you are just playing for lore comat or to just wish for characters you like
4,been playing the game for months the game is good story is interesting the only problem in the size of the game if you guys want a good game with good story this game is for you but also keep in mind that this game is gigabyte and they will keep on updating the game untill we reach the end of story also little suggestion dendro traveler is op if you need a good healer noelle is good for you she can do good damage be a shield for your team and be a healer
4,the game is amazing the game play the story the graphics even the character and npc design is absolutely stunning but oh boy it takes up a ton of storage i do not even know if my device will make it past version haha
4,i love exploring teyat and meeting all the characters the new combat activities ad quest never bore me the only downside is the game size currently with the new fontaine update it takes up forty gigabyteon my phone
4,this game is very fun and i love it the only rhing stopping me from giving it four stars is not being sble to skip dialogue otherwise the battles the characters and everything is wonderful
4,good graphics the gameplay is fun and entertaining the story is good yet is presented in terrible way a nice game to get yourself lost in a fantasy world waste a lot of time but enjoy it
4,great game playing for over a year on android the game is lagging with every update i request the developers to optimize the game so that it runs smoother on phone especially budget phones
4,the game is just epic its so fun to play but the only two reasons i gave four stars is sometimes the puzles get too difficult for players the graphics are cool but for a mobile player well they need to compromise on the graphics and resolution because the phone just gets overheated in five minute
4,dear mihoyo please respond although the gameplay is amazing there are several issues in game which many people complain about we do not really feel too attached to the characters they do not give facial expressions unlike star rail the kits seem repetitive like keqing and alhaitam being almost obvious i am sure new types of kits will help a lot i would like to know when the cloud storage app will be available world wide i will change my reviews after i get a response thank you
4,fun solid game held back only by needing to accommodate mobile users and the lack of any challenging permanent combat modes other than spiral abyss mostly meaningless fetch quests also get old fast
4,this game is the best online adventure mobile game the map is so cool and the monsters and bosses are strong enough to have fun while playing alone or with your friends you can upgrade your characters as you want and the grafic are cool but my problem is with the space why all this space and it downloads a lot maybe half an hour to only enter the game but beside this it is fantastic game
4,okay every time i play one game it literally tells me to download this game but there is something to this game so whenever i was trying to log in after i put the last thing which was the password but it kept saying an error so i kept trying to do it but instead it kept telling me that i was a bot
4,it is been a while since i found good rgp for my phone low and behold genshin impact comes along it is a great game no real problems with it but i have one major complaint why did you turn the main characters attribute to earth in my opinion she was better as wind type alot of the main and the side story line you need a wind type complete and to me you nerfed her down to almost unusable in a lot of the missions granted there are plenty wind types in the game but please turn her back
4,it is really good game but dam why red signal i mean it spike ninety to sevenninety ping even i am close enough to internet connection router no lag but when it reach ninety ninenine ping it reconnect but my character is dead when it get connected maybe i should change server for better ping not the recommended server
4,great game but controls are a bit fiddly probably my fat fingers very engaging world and characters with plenty to do just be prepared for the massive download and long installation several hours before you get stuck in
4,i have played since week and i love this game so much especially since my wife and i can play together the characters are so fun crazy and mysterious and the story just keeps you wanting more i do wish they would fix the artifact grinding somehow because i do not even bother with domains anymore i also really wish they would add another shop slot for a character because there are so many four stars that i will never see because the banners just will not give them to me please mihoyo its been years
4,the game itself is really great the graphics are so good the reason why i just gave it a four star because it is slowly becoming more like a novel game the dialogues is way longer than the actions of the game or adventures etc
4,i love the game it is a must play but it takes up too much space on my device every single update it has it takes about twenty percent of my storage i know that this can not be fixed but i am just letting you know hopefully you will find a fix i really love genshin but for phone users they cannot enjoy the game due to it taking up so much storage
4,love this game but i got my phone restored and i had to reinstall it and takes too long to download edit i still have not reinstalled it and its taking so long so i just do do it my friend wants me to install it and she keeps bugging me so i will try to leave it overnight also this game is really entrataining but some dailys are just hard and i raged and broke my phoneedit again i installed it and i am playing it four seven its addicting and i love it again
4,love the game i have been playing it for ages and i have never lost interest in it a few glitches here and there but over all pretty good the only thing that bothers me is i am do not everything that is out right now so i just log in and do my commissions but that is just me lol
4,it is is a good game but i deducted that one star because i think the spiral abyss is hard it is hard for new players to experience it how are you gonna expect a new player that has to do combat in a time limit but not get the rewards at a certain time stamp please hoyo ty
4,honestly i played the game so much even though it lags my phone since it is a large game i still get past it also the no ads and no need for paying just i am so grateful the only problem i have is how long it takes to upgrade your adventure levels since there are no specific things to do as a starter player to hurry it up i think it is handled a bit better in star rail
4,the game was absolutely awesome there is always new events and can get lots of character but i suggest that weapon can be downgrade to get the materials for upgrading it is really hard these days that upgrading character also changing weapon
4,started like a years ago i do not know but this game had me playing every single day its really fun with all the graphics the lore and the character designs that its so like unique compared to other games i have played so far the storage has been quite the issue and complicates quests or probably i am just dumb but overrall its such an amazing game and i love it
4,genshin is a great and addicting game but it would be so much better if you could transfer game data on different servers or play with anyone around the world instead of your designated server i have been playing for a few years now and it is quite enjoyable that request would things one hundred percent better that is just one and the only little flaw it has but other than that everything is great community is very helpful with helping eachother out and the events are fun would one hundred percent recommend
4,i like this game there are many things you can do it is not boring you can play with friends
4,i would give this game five stars but this game is so amazing to be honest this game makes you burned out sometimes i farm for so long to get a character as soon as i lost fifty fifty my to wanderer i bought a one hundred dollar purshase and guess what five star this game makes you spend to much money and its stressful its really annoying that every time i lose fifty fifty my and i buy stuff its a five star right after it is like their asking you to spend money in order to get a five star this needs to stop
4,its been a year i think since i started this game and it is been a week since i last log in to this game i do not know but i am kinda tired burn out and feeling lazy to log in on to this game the game is good as well as the story it is just that it does not give the same excitement as it gives me before it is a must to experience though
4,been playing for a year now and so far the games really good the terrain and the views are the best part apart from the story but after the archon quests there feels a lack of content to do the only problem is that the phone heats up like crazy and so i can only play for a short time before i have to let it cool down
4,the story line up is really good but it takes so much time to come up with the story quests for the past six months only filler quests are introduced
4,i absolutely love this game it is been a comfort game of mine for years now i want to continue with this game but i am starting to run out of storage for it i love the game but there needs to be something else for storage management i have deleted many apps because of the storage but still barely have enough room
4,so i never got into the hype about genshin at release only decided to try it after playing star rail and i get it game is beautiful and enormous and borrows heavily from breath of the wild i find the action combat not entirely suitable for mobile but besides that everything else about the game is remarkably well done
4,this game is very good they are very generous with the content however there are things that can be improved first the resin there are so many things to do here that requires resins raise the resin to at least forty or sixty and players will be happy second the rng ik the devs will probably do not hing about it but i really hope there is some way to make the rng a little bit better third please put a skip button sometimes like during the npcs event dialogues they make my head ache
4,wish you can use an xbox controller like on the iphone version but the frame rate is better on android i would definitely give it five stars once you can connect third party controllers to play i like to cast to a tv and play when i travel
4,i love this game but so i give a good rating but i did not log in for a couple weeks and when i went back on it restarted my whole game i was and still so sad and upset i would really like to get my account back cause i tried to log in it said account does not exist please help please bro you all update i got my account back a long time ago hoyoverse is really decated to costumer service so if something like this happens to you i would contact them and it gets fixed within a few days
4,this game is great some of the quest are hard but overall it was a great experience however when i tried to login in a my chromebook with the account i always use it kep on saying my email or password was wrong when it was not
4,it is a great game and i thoroughly enjoy playing it and exploring the free roam however i am facing an issue where i cannot download the update even though i have more than enough space on my phone please fix this problem as i will not be able to play the game otherwise
4,awesome graphics if your phone can handle and render them when played for the first time it gives a whole different level of experience and controls are realistic with a top notch bgm and other sound effects very well built game by the developers
4,giving this game a four stars instead of five because the characters are amazing and even the graphics are gold but the stories that you have to complete is so boring and they are so bad and yet sometimes so hard to do and it takes forever to discover the new worlds but ethier way the game is pretty good i do recommend it if your only looking for good graphics and fighting
4,this game is amazing i love it so much the characters designs are incredible and the archon quests are very enjoyable too my only problem is that it takes too much storage i litrealy deleted every game on my phone but it is still saying i need to make more space i do not know what to do anymore
4,although my luck is pretty bad and never won the fiftys free to play by the way reason of four stars this game is fantastic it is addictive not sure if that is good it helps you escape from reality it gives you friends that will never betray you it is music sends you to the land of fantasies it is characters are gorgeous their voice acting is superb the story is insane the world to explore is fun and huge it makes your phone a very good hand roaster it fills your storage to the brim but most of all must play game
4,by far one of the best mmorpg that you can play on multiple platforms my only qualm is i wish there was an auto pick up items option would make it easier to collect items on mobile for sure
4,great game however i feel that without support for kishi backbone and other attach to phone game controllers games such as this one is not at it is full mobile potential as the onscreen gamepad is not a sufficient alternative to buttons and joysticks
4,good game over all but recently e and my friend had this problem we has always played cooperative she is on playstation and i am on mobile but on july when we went on to play she tried to join me but it said i was offline and when she tried to view my profile it said cannot few information i tried to join her pot but it did not show up for her she is adventure rank fifty four and i am adventure rank four if you know how to fix it please help
4,the game is really addictive and also i really like it especially when you get to fight enemies but there is not really much to do just have to do quest did not really get to fight but it is fun either way
4,good game been played since pandemic stopped for a year and re play it recently a suggestion is please remove or do another app for that tcg some of us not a fan of card game do not know how much space it use maybe could save some space for only open world genshin hahah thanks
4,i would have given a five star review but after the two point zero update the loading on the preparing to load data screen has gotten a lot longer it is not a internet connection problem i have tried changing my connection but it does not work overall the game is good and gives an enjoyable experience would absolutely recommend and please fix the loading timers
4,a great story playing game but it lacks some optimisation on xiaomi pad six even though this tab is powered by sd eightseventy the game looks pixelated on some areas while fighting on max graphics and i can feel minor jitters then and there but overall it is a mind blowing game for sure
4,i love the gameplay since starting i could not put it down now i am having issues with the app randomly cutting off in mid gameplay this is my only frustrating matter
4,good game but not really five stars would say that the game file size is getting a bit too big with customisations and all and four more story plots regions yet to be released at this time the developers could consider optimising by making a part part of the game on mobile devices splitting the regions on each part of the game with shared account access information on characters inventory and event maps
4,i have been playing since four ver my summary combats two artifacts one gacha four exploration five graphic sfx five story five if you want a skill based combats this game is not for you with the worst unimproved artifacts rng it will be impossible to deal ideal damage moreover the combats are bland clunky and too slow for me the enemies patterns are not exciting to play too then all you do is tap skill change teammate tap skill tap burst yada yada others great
4,great game with no end content and a very expensive wishing system take your time through the story as it gets boring and repetitive once you finish the main quest line
4,a very good game with beautiful graphics and nice gameplay sometimes the game feels boring and i feel like some of the characters and some of the story is pretty bad but i guess its ok eight over ten for me
4,good game wish there was better camera control especially for mobile users i keep getting my camera plunged in to the grass whenever i get hit in combat and the sensitivity to pull the camera back to normal is such a hassle especially if your trying to stay alive pressing other buttons
4,surprisingly high quality for a mobile game like actual videogame kinda game i have some nitpicks with it though mainly related to its gacha monetization system and the horribly uninteresting main protags but otherwise the games legitimately interesting both gameplay wise and background lore main story lore is eh i do not know the main protags traveller and paimon are absolute mistakes and literally anything could be a better replacement to them at this point if it is to fix the main story
4,has high quality graphics awesome songs and gameplay and many nice husbandos and waifus to choose from not much for main story rn but many sub quests and fillers gacha is just okay every update gives decent amount of primo to farm save properly and can roll for gacha downsides for this game are the lack of fun in solving most puzles artifact farming is also boring needs lots of grinding that also needs luck to get decent stats to make characters more stronger overall good free to play game
4,the best open world action game that i have experienced only drawback is that it takes a lot of storage and it is especially worrisome for mobile players i hope they make a cloud or something to store our progress elsewhere
4,amazing you can explore adventure or live a peaceful life i definitely recommend this game to all types of people the only problem is that sometimes it will not let me login so i have to try like ten times to login
4,when i first installed this game i thought its would be a fun free roam game to play in my free time and i was sure right the only bad thing i would say about this game is that it is really hard to level up and the amount of exp it requires other than that it is a great game
4,the game looks great i had issues at first when the game was released but now it is running better than ever i just wish there was controller support for the android version i mean there is a pc and playstation version that support controllers but not the mobile version weird
4,the game got a lot better than it was years ago definitely worth playing love the soundtrack wish it worked on more low spec phones as well but that is asking too much
4,i love the game it is nice and is really good with art and other fields it has many characters i just wish you could level up the adventure rank faster
4,i love genshin but there is only one problem and its the fact you cannot switch in between playstation and mobile pc which is really annoying as it would be great to be able to play with a controller without having to restart
4,it is too good graphics character designs animation and quests but there is one problem will the downloads aur updates whenever i start the game even after hrs it shows to download fiftysixmb data every time different data please fix it or insert a option that we can download it later it is a request by the way nice game
4,its such a addicting app with mesmerising graphics probably my favourite gacha game out there however the only problem i have is that it takes up far too much storage i do not want to get rid of it but if my phone cannot handle how big the app gets i will have no choice but to uninstall it
4,the game is good but i hoped that it has more endgame content rather than abyss commissions and resin burn it is gotten so boring now but what really made me come back into it are the characters especially the drip marketing looking forward for fontaine
4,great game it would be five star but wish i could play with my backbone controller please add the compatibility how come iphone is supported but not android i have had to stop playing since i got my backbone using the screen sucks
4,really really cool game but i do believe there is an issue where some of the character designs were a little off to what they should of been like how some characters were based of of poc but ended up being very light skinned other than the character design issues there are not many issues it runs a little slow sometimes but that is mostly it
4,really amazing open world game it is really interesting and detailed even going as far as giving mobs great background stories unfortunately after the latter half of the patch the game has been lagging so much looking like a stop motion picture production and taking too long to open even the paimon menu this led to me not being able to play properly and ultimately losing interest in playing the game i hope to be able to play the game with ease when i can afford a better phone
4,the graphics gameplay and characters are all exceptional the music is perfect however the developers should really find a way to make the artifact rng a lot less brutal it is utterly ridiculous to spend months in a single domain in the hopes of getting decent artifacts at the very least i love the game and i do not mind spending money on characters that i really want to get but the repetitively merciless rng on artifact farming sometimes takes away the fun and enjoyment from the game
4,amazing its so fun to play and to level up butmi have a hard time when i am in the snowy mountain highly dangerous in the game it is really nice to play but it glitches alot i am on a chromebook ios but the game would glitch and kick me out sometimes and on my chrome i cannot hear the persons voices i do not understand the meaning of the game and story but it is fun only problem it takes up a bunch of storage but otherwise it is a win win situationten over tenhighly recommend for anime lovers
4,its a good game i love the character designs the big world to explore and the story quests and character stories the reason why i rate it four stars since i have been encountering a problem and this problem just happened now from my years of playing the game the problem is i get lag spikes and sometimes it forces my controller to move characters and to do stuff it is hard for me to play abyss and explore the map if this problem keeps happening
4,the game and story are amazing the graphics are top quality the characters are easy to like in many different ways and the lore is glorious i do have a few issues with the wishing system though it takes so long to save up for characters and if you get them you have to make sure you have a good weapon for them usually at least a four star and the amount of primo that are available against the amount that you need to have in order to have a chance at getting the character are very unfair
4,it is a great mmorpg game different from others with awesome graphics and i really like is that the game is cross platform which is convenient concept is impressive but i have been playing it since they start and i stopped playing after an year or so and downloaded it back again game has gotten a lot advanced than it was before and it is really difficult to get of the top of things back again they need to give a head start to the players who join back after a long time
4,last year i tried playing on mobile and it crashed immediately after i reached mondstadt i even had to restart my phone yesterday i gave it a second chance still on phone i must say i am quite impressed no crashing the visuals are amazing sometimes there is a bit of lag but the rest is spectacular i love the fact it is complex and there are interesting quests and stuff though i would play it on pc but i have not got enough space even on phone it was hard to free up some space but it is worth it
4,great characters gameplay and story the four star rating is for the huge file size as well as lag and frequent disconnection and reconnection from the servers our internet is quite fast so i do not understand why it happens the environment also takes a while to load especially after a long glide the lag gets too horrible sometimes that it takes time for the characters to switch and enemies to appear
4,the game is actually beautiful the designs the graphics music and the lore is amazing but some changes would be really really nice first thing being increasing the resin and condensed resin cap and the map markers secondly the artifact grind is very boring and repetitive it would be nice to have some other way of receiving and rerolling artifacts ofcourse some balancing patches would be great to adjust the older characters so they remain relevant with the current state of the game
4,one of the best games i ever played the graphic art lore gameplay and even music are great collecting and building characters is really fun and exciting the support is helpful and fast the only reason why i do not give a five star rating is the rng system of artifact is too painful even if we put so much efforts the chances of getting a good artifact is too low besides our main character the traveler deserves lot of free skins
4,amazing game extremely entertaining and constantly changing beautiful scenery and solid characters the only problem is the grind as you become an experienced player putting in so much time and effort for almost minimal results when pulling for characters gets extremely tedious the system definitely needs to change otherwise i love it
4,the game has great graphics and a good sense of adventure wide variety of characters story wise it is fine nothing amazing i however dislike that the game is not very optimised or very efficient with the devices chipsetflagship included or is not designed to be as how easily it takes for my device to become a hand warmer during the winter no matter the setting if it was an hour through it would be understandable but it just takes a few minutes to heat up
4,i am finding the game a lot of fun to play it is a lot like the games that are played on the playstation or the xbox i love the cut scenes the plot and the animation they all are amazing and make the game so much better the only issue i have is that i do not think something like this game should be on phones mainly because my phone at least cannot handle it i am not getting that high frame rates so if you decide to play the game get it on a pc or playstation five
4,overall i love this game and its very fun to play with cute characters and an interesting lore however i would like to play this game everyday but it takes up far to much storage and on certain devices even lags to the point you pretty much cannot play the game anymore the last time i was able to play was about weeks ago and when i tried a different device windows computer it just blacks out
4,the foremost issues i face is storage however that is the nature of well made games the second issue is that it takes over eight hours to load at first this is quite irksome but i am not sure that is a problem that can be fixed otherwise the game is wonderful lots of gameplay can keep you entertained for a while and i really love the way the multiplayer function works
4,amazing game one of the best rpgs i have played in years it gets buggy here and there but honestly with all the graphics it has to render at a time i do not blame it all you have to do if something stops working or if it starts crashing is close it and reopen and it will take you to the closes savepoint which also it saves very often so you never have to worry about losing anything which is perfect my only nitpick is paimon our companion she really rubs me the wrong way with her character
4,speaking as a pc player the game can be extremely hard to run for lower end devices and i could not even install it on my phone but other than that i do not have many problems easy to use controls and a beautiful environment it can get overwhelming with bunch of world quests to do but in any other aspect is a wonderful game keep it up
4,this game is amazing i personally love the art style not to mention the backstory of the characters is fairly interesting and the attention to detail from the trees moving when you run through them to what i have seen so far all the npcs having some form of dialoge about themselves or their situation my only issue is that their seems to be no way to remap controls i have not ran into a bug or error so cannot point that out in short amazing game
4,i love genshin impact i have played for years and the story is so captivating i love the game play style the reason it is four stars instead of five is because of all the dialogue i personally do not mind it too much but a ton of players have problems with it at the beginning of the game it was short bits of dialogue and now it literally takes me hours to get through it all all i ask is for it to be a little shorter or for a skip button for us i still love the game though
4,i absolutely love this game my mind revolves around it four seven i was overjoyed to find this on my chromebook but i did have some issues the whole log in process was extremely slow and when i did get in the animation quality was quite poor i even tried to adjust it also after ish days i had trouble getting into the game like the screen is just black and if i click close it turns white and i have to go to the top right corner to exit again ah also the sound sometimes just lags
4,great game the only reason i gave it a four and not a five is the control mechanism for mobile there have been quite a few times when i would try to move the camera around and i would either accidentally jump or attack if you could make the user interface maybe half an inch small that would be perfect other than that the character design the storyline and the visuals of the game are amazing for just a mobile game great job cognosphere pte llc love the game
4,the combat is so easy to learn and is super fun to mess around with the graphics are honesty breathtaking my phone is filled with screetshots from this game the storyline is somewhat less impressive depending on the region it can go to fantastic to downright bad another low point is the small amount of currency available to free to play for a billion dollar game the amount of free stuff they give out is appalling overall it is a very good game though i would not recommend it to friends
4,i love the graphic designs and the story it takes a while to finish a simple quest yet very entertaining i also like the characters they are so unique the only problem i am having is the camera sensitivity especially with the aiming part it is kinda hard to move the camera in mobile i do not know if it also happens in other devices but hopefully they add a little bit more of that setting overall amazing
4,it is an amazing game the graphics are on a different level absolutely incredible only thing is it takes up so much storage and it is really hard to get your favourite characters without spending hours on quests and farming for chests like the chances of getting a five star is in ninety wishes i have spent the past days trying to save up but i am no where near close though on a more serious note i do hope they come up with a way to keep storage down because it is used up fifty of mine highly recommend
4,it is a lovely game the graphics are beautiful and the voice acting is amazing the character design is gorgeous and the story line is fun to follow i have only been playing for a day but i am already having so much fun the only thing stopping me from rating this five stars is that sometimes during the longer cut scenes lag out the audio will glitch or a combination of both i would have to close out the app and restart it restarting the cut scene besides that it is a wonderful game ten over ten
4,the game is fun to play good graphics storylines pretty places to discover and gorgeous characters but overall it is not fair for low end devices to experience such horrid gameplay like for example there is no grass the water is glowing with bloom on the numbersdmg or in battle reactions and last it lags on new places as well it would be a big help if the developers would fix it
4,absolutely amazing runs great on my phone and the storyline is really engaging however it takes a ridiculous amount of storage so if you do not have storage to spare i would not reccomend if you do however the controls and gameplay mechanics are easy enough to get the hang of and i would highly reccomend playing it i no longer have enough storage left to play it on my phone or laptop but it was great while it lasted
4,beautiful music visuals and voice acting i loved this on the console and pc and the mobile experience is surprisingly good the game file is massive i do not play it on mobile anymore i think the games biggest weakness is its reliance on the gacha system the characters are mostly well designed at least until sumerus but the story seems to showcase these new characters rather than provide satisfying progression of the plot good enough for some but not enough to keep me thank you though
4,it is an incredible game that i have been playing for a while the controls are really good for a mobile game and i was delighted to find out how huge the open world is there is so much stuff that you discover even after having gone through an area many times before i wish there was more diversity in the characters like different skin tones body types and such instead of just thin adult and maybe a child and there are occasional glitches of the same npc during a cutscene but overall
4,i have played the game on my playstation before and it was amazing good graphics storyline the lot the only problems i have had is that you cannot choose your region kn the playstation meaning i cannot play with any of my friends i am also unable to download it on phone it continues pending without installing it is the only app that has this issue
4,the release of sumeru gave so much to do i have been playing for over a year it is got amazing graphics and tons of different characters to choose from the story has got us anticipating more although it is captivating it is not really new player friendly the new characters and weapons require items that new players cannot have access to it can cause them to rush through the story other than that however the game has been treating us nicely i hope the second year anniversary will not fail us
4,i love the game and that i can play on my phone or my playstation navigation on the mobile is a little difficult also making combat a little difficult i did have some trouble signing in on my new phone but afterwards it has run very well the uses of the in game menu is very easy to use and because i am on my phone it is easier to get to web based links vs playstation
4,definitely a great game that is made great strides compared to the first time i installed it it is still very laggy especially as the game includes more but it is improved it is not very free to play friendly though for the amount of characters coming out the spacing of events and primo possible make it very difficult to achieve getting characters i experienced this in a major way as a beginner because of the large gap in what i wanted versus what was possible
4,this game is truly amazing and getting better day by day though it has many bugs and features that could be fixed for a better game experience one minus my major issue is the storage this game is taking i am not sure if there is a fix for it but it is getting out of hand and many mobile players are being forced to fully quit two minus on mobile most times the chat will not open or glitch in cooperative which is annoying but it usually comes back after a few seconds though its overall a great game i love it
4,the game is very fun to play although i am always skipping the dialogue a lot because the fighting style is more interesting the puzles are great it is a great game but no end game just one suggestion can we just have a choice where you can choose what you prefer black screen or white screen in the main screen after you opened game it hurts your eyes a lot and thank you if you reading this
4,the game is super fun and the plot is intriguing i enjoy the colorful cast of characters as well as the aspect of having your own home amd decorating it as you see fit if i had one complaint it be that the system of getting new characters is a bit hard but not enough to really dissuade me from playing or from trying again i was kinda saddened to see we could not get clothes from other regions for the traveler but it is a small nitpick not a real problem
4,i love the game everything from storyline graphics to game play only issue i have is that i wish i could use my bluetooth keyboard to play it i have played on computer and prefer the controls though it shows the option to chance input you cannot actually change it to keyboard or controller other than that amazing game highly recommend it
4,this game is gorgeous and fun and so easy to lose track of time playing i get really sucked into the world it does take up a lot of space but i feel it is absolutely worth it i have it in my phone and on my playstation though playing on mobile can be really tricky at times i recently learned i can connect a bluetooth controller to my phone but there is no setting on mobile for a controller option
4,it is an amazing game both lore and gameplay wise the action and combat in this game are really good although in mobile the graphics are a bit hard to control aiming and shooting are really difficult and sometimes even simple things like activating a wind glider becomes a bit difficult although if you are going for the story you should download this game if you want a smoother experience i would recommend a computer for better gameplay
4,this game is absolutely stunning and the designers have really outdone themselves characters are engaging and interesting story is intriguing and well thought out graphics are stunning it is a little confusing navigating the game at first because there is not a lot of guidance but that encourages the player to run around and explore so why the four stars the massive amount of space it takes up on my phone almost thirty giga is forcing me to uninstall unfortunately gonna see if my laptop can run it
4,i like genshin impact it is fun the story is never boring the art and characters are amazing but i do have one problem i feel like the game takes up way to much data there is almost no way to play it unless you have basically zero data taken up maybe if there was a way to change it i would be happier with my experience
4,absolutely love genshin the storyline is great and the graphics are amazing i rated it four out of five stars because the apps takes up a lot of storage which makes the game lag when loading in new areas on a side note after the seven update my phone did not have enough space to play the game anymore and i do not have a pc to play on either however i do have a chromebook the issue is that genshin is not supported on chromebook so can the developers please make the game accessible to other devices
4,it is an amazing app but it is getting hard to continue to play on mobile it is taking up a bunch of storage infact after two point seven i will have point zero four gigabyte left plus as new characters come out older characters do not have reruns as much ex kazuha and the lag on mobile is frustrating but i do like the idea of an ascension quest it helps me prepare for higher leveled enemies and lets me stay at a world level i am comfortable at the graphics are also absolutely wonderful they are beautiful
4,been playing for almost years now and i can safely say amazing game and the graphics is absolutely phenomenal one thing though if you like collecting characters but you are not willing to spend money on the game well it is going to be a thorny ride for you otherwise you still can clear most of the games content with lower rarity characters
4,overall it is a super fun game it is got me practically addicted only problem that i have is the amount of space it takes up no matter how many things i delete it still continously says that i have insufficient storage because of this i play on my playstation other problem is when i am close to adventure rank sixty there is not much to do but commissions events or farming it gets boring now and then to log on but not being able to do much but other than that i love the game so much
4,just perfect great story simple controls awesome graphics and gaming in general with a cool new open world cooperative multiplayer rpg anime style kind of concept i just need a more powerfull device to get back to playing it it is just impossible for me to ever get tired playing it but still just like any other game this one provides some advantage for those willing to pay for special items basically those generic in game purchases wich are a bummer but anyway
4,it is an amazing game the visuals are beautiful the music is so emmersive the storyline is awesome everything about it is perfect except for the fact that it does not work well on mobile devices i mostly play on my phone and most everything works fine but when it comes to a cut scene it keeps freezing and it will not work on my laptop other than that everything is amazing and it is and awesome game would totally recomend if you do not mind the cut scene thing on mobile have the right laptop
4,it is fun and beautiful the fact that it is free is insane however some of the tasks i wish had more direction like a help section for tasks or a hint since some tasks were way easier than how long it took to complete also i wish the tutorial was available at all times sometimes i have not been online in some time so i forget some key info that would help other than this it is absolutely a five
4,it takes a super long time to load i hope they make the software easier to process on some devices because it takes so long to load and it runs very slow on a decent computer other than that the game is amazing its easy to pick up its worldbuilding is phenominal you fall in love with the characters and it is free it does not free a ton of space though lmao
4,it is definitely an amazing experience especially with the details of lore and the different settings however i think that the cooperative experience can definitely be enhanced and unfortunately the game is not suitable for all devices like mobile because the game takes up too much storage otherwise it is a really cool game
4,the new patch will no longer let me log in i am stuck on the download page and have no idea what to do with this i really do love this game the stories are incredible the character designs are impeccable and the events are so fun however it can become really competitive as once you grow your worlds levels it gets pretty hard and can get very annoying otherwise i love the game and i am very invested even when it gets hard i simply keep coming back i swear it is a addictive lol
4,i downloaded it because of the hype and i have played other mihoyo games before but not for long because i cannot get into the character rotation it just is not my type of battle system so i already failed at the third temple lol when the wind riding and tile jumping stuff becomes the main hurdle to overcome in order to progress without finishing this crucial quest you cannot go on in the game however graphics animation story voice actor music the many game modes it is all absolutely fabulous
4,it is a great game but i am only giving it four stars the game is very open great characters storyline is awesome hints of romance etc my only problems are some quests are very annoying to complete because it dosnt actually show you where to go and it gets frustrating so maybe more hints would be nice my biggest issue is the adventure rank as i said it is a great game with lots to do but the adventure rank leveling gets very tedious and annoying please fix it thanks
4,i love this game sure it can get a little boring when you have been playing for an year but it is still fun there is a lot you can do but i do have some minuses first of all i think primo are way too hard to get sometimes there might be good events and all but otherwise it is almost impossible to get many without spending money and also it takes way too much storage on phone that is why i play it on playstation
4,a very nice game really love the design gameplay story and many more i hope that you guys can continue doing the good work personally the issue i found about the game is storage took about four of my phones storage other issue is the combat camera settings very hard to control because sometimes while in combat the camera glitched through walls or floor so its hard to fight sometimes overall quite enjoy the game
4,the game is fantastic amazing graphics story line characters open world type of deal and tons of things to do the cons if you do spend money on the game the best value for a buck is actually the nine ninety nine one if you were to spend dollar if you purchase the pack three times you will actually get more gems then if you were to just purchase the pack something they should consider changing there are more two cons just not enough space to type them out
4,the gameplay and graphics are extremely excellent compared to other free games depending on your device of course the design of the newest characters are extraordinary and the cinematics are just mind blowing however this game lacks of creativity if we are talking about the events and the rewards we get are as disappointing but whats fun about this game is not the events but playing with your favorite characters and making them stronger exploring the world and finishing the quests
4,overall it is an amazing game but there are a few bugs and not much to do in cooperative it glitches out sometimes when you are fighting and the screen stays frozen the story is great and all the characters are fine as well but since the graphics are amazing it takes up a lot of space so it is just better to play on pc there is a lot to explore and to unlock on the map using the gacha is kinda worth using money on but you might end up only getting weak weapons
4,the game overall is really good great updates and events a beautiful and huge map to explore and it is not even complete yet not to talk about the lore which is awesome despite the fact that the company sometimes makes bad mistakes the late game experience being a bit boring and limited and the prices for in game purchases not being too good for some regions brazil as an example it is an awesome game and it is worth trying
4,good game graphics are well done with only a few wall issues for the most part the camera is responsive and in auto mode it usually stays well focused sometimes when in a small space the camera zooms in so far that you cannot see what you are doing the enemies and power scaling are fairly balanced mage and sword combat is smooth archers are a bit clumbsy overall still a good game that could use a few tweaks to be great
4,great game i enjoy playing it alot i just have one issue whit the new event misty dungeon please make it so that enemies cannot get you stuck in walls it has happened multiple times and every time i have been pushed against a wall an enemy comes and somehow manages to stand below me while i get pushed in the air and stuck in a wall the worst part is that the only way to get out is for the enemy to move so i can get on the ground again but they just refuse to move please fix this problem
4,game runs pretty smoothly sometimes better than my pc but i have got a few issues cannot listen to music apps in the background because this app closes em it is pretty annoying after you switch apps for a second it takes you back to login loading screen sometimes it crashes for no reason saying game not responding four resin replenishes so slowly hour it should be six at least but even though it is pretty good graphics story characters locations game mechanics are epic
4,hundreds of hours of cool unique beautiful free gameplay the end game is lackluster when you simply run out of quests with no more reasons to kill monsters and explore if you do not stress about farming good gear or the abyss mode where you need good gear or the best heroes then there is very little to be disappointed about very relaxing game take your time focus on maximizing fun not on maximizing character team power enjoy
4,even though i did not l the y anniversary awards the company has nothing to do with the game itself as much as it sounds weird this game changed my life for the better started bonding with friends more escape reality and play with favorite characters not to mention beautiful graphics character design and genius voice acting wish the awards could be as good as in the beginning but still a great experience
4,i almost never rate my apps but games like this is exeptional and if anyone is wondering whether or not it is worth the phone storage it takes up the answer is yes i did however encounter a slight glitch in the intro story animation where the audio and images were breaking up but it did not last the controls are smooth and the environment you can interact with are surprisingly many i cannot even imagine the kind of work that was put into this to achieve this level of detail love the art
4,dynamic gameplay awesome graphics and complex lore content comes out at a comfortable pace great variety of limited time events so there is a bit of everything for everybody main issue is the lack of receptivity on part of the game towards player feedback people have been complaining about resin asking for buffs to characters that have fallen off etc but changes not forthcoming i will keep playing but will not recommend cannot say it will be worth for sure many games out there to choose
4,i love the game i think it is very enjoyable and has interesting storylines aditionally the game does not require one to pay to unlock many features which is perfect for players who play for free however i am experiencing the same problem each time i complete the peak of vindagnyr once i complete it the barrier to get the rewards is not removed and so my characters die from the cold and i get a challenge failed notice
4,the anniversary rewards are lackluster and the performance on the phone is harsh and heats up the device too fast that being said the game while being played on a device that can handle it is fantastic the characters are charismatic and easily loveable the progression of both story and difficulty is well balanced and there is always something to do even in end game i highly recommend this to someone who enjoys open world rpgs with the occasional multiplayer beautiful game overall
4,i play on both mobile and pc i do not really recommend this on mobile it is hard to play there it gets laggy and it makes your phone overheat and if your on an android user it is becomes worse cause it can cause your phone to black out and automatically leave the game plus it takes up so much storage with everything update but on the positive side it is a great game i would honestly recommend it to people it can get addicting and has great storyline graphics and amazing characters
4,one of my favourite games to play day in day out great graphics amazing character designs quality kits etc if you take things slowly you will probably never get burned out but that is only if you take things slowly if you complete quests and events too quickly the game becomes really stale as all you have to do is use your resin and do dailies if you are up for a long grind this game is great
4,the game is great a bit grindy the rates for character summoning are low but it still is fun because all characters are good depending on how you play them there are some issues such as compatibility on mobile and terrain and other things taking about a whole minute to render properly which is very annoying during time challenges also the game just had it is first anniversary and it was completely underwhelming for such a great game it is still very much fun to play though and i recommend it
4,absolutely fantastic and beautiful game amazing voice acting fun characters with fun and different lands to explore but cannot bring myself to bring it back to five star yet due to the travesty that was the anniversary event they shut us up with a ten pull and a wing glider but it does not solve the underlying issue of them not communicating and ignoring the players i love this game and want to see it succeed still a very fun game though and i would hate to stop playing because of this issue
4,the game is visually stunning and defiantly something i have recommended to friends and acquaintances i love the open world aspect the characters designs and most of the story the new inazuma update is lacking the story telling and build up that monstadt and liyue were given making it difficult to feel any way towards the characters also as someone in the higher levels i find it difficult to keep the motivation to trudge through dungeons for artifacts when i get basically useless pieces
4,the main story is maintained and our objectives are clear choices are here and sometimes matter and sometimes do not the graphics are good and enjoyable the designs of the characters are well made and easy to remember the map is pretty big for an open world mobile game maybe a few things to work on for the devs add more quests and more mobs for us to have more divertissement and things to discover
4,i love this game in general this game is well developed fun yet also challenging the anniversary rewards are great and i would love to see the next regions with new characters one thing though the texting thing on mobile glitches sometimes when you send the message it is still in the text box so if you are spamming the send button like i do you would send the message again it is not that big of a deal just a slight annoyance
4,the game is pure eye candy and a joy to play for newcomers veteran players however have slim pickings there is not a meaningful amount of late game content you are really only left with daily commissions and bi monthly abyss resets there is also a major lack of usability settings on all platforms such as an unlimited fps option more granular resolution options as well as gamepad support on android addressing these issues and better communication would go a long way for the game
4,i honestly love the game so much and its the first time i have ever spent this much time and effort on a single game everything from character design to backstory visuals to music and even gameplay and story plot are amazing it is just the rewards the game gives do not really feel worth the effort put in for example high adventure rank level up rewards and the anniversary rewards as well still the game is super fun and ten over ten would recommend anyone to play it
4,genshin is a very good game especially for free to play the graphics are good and the storyline is interesting your able to explore the world while fighting opponents you can also cooperative with your friends to complete quests and missions i highly recommend this game but it does require a large data storage when played on the ohone the audio and cut scene may tend to glitch
4,the game it is self is great the graphics is great the characters design is great the storyline is amazing though now there not a lot to do not a lot of exploring all it is waiting for certain things commission events new quest resin etc and rewards you would get from exploring or from quest events is now going downhill i still love this game but i wish there were more ways to get rewards personal recommendation make the current parts of teyvat bigger like x two to x ten and add more loot
4,generally an excellent game but it comes with it is problems the resources are really scarce and even when completing all events it is hard to level all characters you want you always have to choose carefully what you will invest into additionally the late game is kinda boring apart from events you basically have spiral abyss only which is thirty minutes of gameplay every two weeks i just wished there was more things to do and more rewards for getting strong and high adventure rank
4,the game is actually really good do not let the sudden increase in bad reviews fool you obviously at the start you have got more things to do and later on when you have done everything there will not be much to do i think that is pretty normal for games to be honest and i have played plenty the amount of effort mhy put into a free game the graphics gameplay voice acting music is phenomenal as a casual player who knows how to save primo for characters i want i do not find anything wrong with the rewards
4,the game is very beautiful in its design and art the story is also interesting and i look forward to the tales that unfold in teyvat however there are a few problems with it despite being designed for phone it started to slowly slowly get stuck which forced me to uninstall the game and move to pc the characters were interesting in the start but recently they all feel like a remake of some old neglected characters with only a few changes and sometimes none
4,i really enjoy this game hard to believe i get the same amount of content as the console version on mobile i only wish there was controller support for the android version of this game it is not easy to fighting tough enemies with the screen controls other than that the soundtrack graphics and story and characters make this a great overall experience
4,my only gripe it is missing controller support for android beautiful game with tons to do as well as cooperative and an engaging battle system story and voice acting is good it can be frustrating to move and dodge exactly the way you would like which is where controller support comes in but unfortunately that feature is limited to ios at the moment that is the only thing keeping it from a prefect score you will not regret downloading this game
4,it is a blast to play on pc but it becomes a whole other story on mobile even on lowest settings a new gen phone can barely handle the game even on the lowest settings frame drops are constant and it affects gameplay to the point it is unplayable otherwise the content in this game so far is great just hope the mobile build becomes optimized
4,this is a really fun game but i had to download it on my phone as it would not work on pc the only issue with mobile is that i have large hands so it gets uncomfortable if they added the option of controller support on mobile that would be really helpful for others with large hands that get cramped from playing for long periods of time would give this a five outta five if they added the option to hook up a controller as it would make combat a lot easier too
4,i changed my rating from five stars to four stars still love the game but the controls in mobile is just pretty wonky ping is not the issue but there are times where i suddenly stop movingrun while fighting or i jump when my finger is not even close to the jump button or i could not dash on time even though i timed my dash the difference between the controls in mobile and pc is huge i hope that we could at least change the layout and settings of the buttons
4,phenomenal game graphics are top notch and the gameplay is interesting enough to keep you hooked for a long time very action packed and the fights are fun as they require tactics and skill after a point my only complain as a mobile player is the fact that the game closes if i accidentally click on another app for just a second the game takes a while to load so it gets annoying when you have to restart everytime you get a call or accidentally click on a notification
4,this game is amazing but there are some issues i have with the game when i play the lag is so ridiculously bad that i can barely move around without it freezing up on me also the animated scenes such as the dragon scene does not render in well it just shows blue everywhere i would love to see you fix this and i would love to play this more the pc version is my personal favorite but it would be fun to play mobile
4,this game is overall amazing the graphics are great and the character designs are stunning the one problem i have had with it is having the game overheat my phone ipad depending what i am playing on and the game also tends to crash every hour or so the graphics and good quality make up for it though exceeded my expectations for a free game
4,fantastic game beautiful graphics and amazing gameplay this is by far one of the longest and best games i have ever played however there are still some issues such as the infamous resin problem the artifact system is also quite bad imagine grinding in a domain for hours and all you get is just a defence or hp type of artifact it is just disappointing but other than that everything is good
4,the game is very fun and it provides lots of content at first when you start there is an overwhelming amount of content but then down the road after around adventure rank forty five it is just all gone plus at around adventure rank forty five is when you have to constantly grind materials and the limiting factor is resin you get very little and it replenishes slowly however the game is still very enjoyable and the abyss is a fun challenge fights are fun and graphics are great overall good game
4,this game is adventurous fun exciting and eventful you can defeat bosses meet new companions and buddies and explore forests mountains lakes and much more although on mobile if you have not enough space and delete games you really like and end up still having not enough space its frustrating and annoying please make the game smaller or just lower the detail so it does not take up that much storage space
4,its really addicting and all the characters are quite unique the one thing that bothers me is how laggy it is i am not sure if it is because of the device i am using but during most of the fights i seem to be lagging like crazy even switching characters take about seconds and sometimes it does not change at all
4,everything seems good but i still have issues with using the bow in mobile sometimes the sensitivity when aiming is not what it seems an example is when i try to aim at something but moving the screen around to adjust the aim at the enemy feels very heavy sometimes it feels like it is buggy laggy so i cannot aim properly my ping is usually green and sometimes yellow i know about the new features added in the settings for bows to help in aiming but it still does not help with my problem
4,love the open world maps and the character attack moves missions are interesting but like every game with missions gets a bit repetitive my only complaint about an otherwise beautiful game is the gotcha system for heroes i was lucky to get a qiqi my first week playing but after about one hundred attempts i gave up trying to get another one to level her up i do not mind spending money but the odds are too low and with new characters added all the time the odds just seem to get worse
4,the game is absolutely amazing great graphics interesting storyline amazing characters and awesome gameplay although it eats up so much of your storage unless you have enough space on your device consider if you are willing to free up eight gigabyte plus the download time in game is horrible so pros and cons i love this game kinda forced to by my brain after putting so much effort in to setting it up to be honest but still amazing worthwhile for me
4,i wish there was a system where you can pet the dogs cats but other than that the games pretty fun i have experienced multiple bugs where when you teleport to a way point it glitches you through the map and you die instantly from the fall damage and then when you try to teleport somewhere else you fall through the map and die again also the last couple times i did the use ten wishes at once thing it bugged out took my wishes crashed and did not give me anything bummer
4,may as well update my review i would give it five stars because it is the best mobile game i have ever played it is not pay to win and it is an open world adventure with compelling plot the reason it is four stars there are some bugs i really look forward to the team working on crashes and stuttering cut scenes though the stuttering may be my phones fault for not being powerful enough there was one boss that kept charging out of bounds by itself and then resetting the encounter back at full hp
4,it is been a lot of fun and the microtransactions do not feel aggregious or necessary to play the only issue i have run into is the slowing during cutscenes i have not been able to watch a single cutscenes without the video lagging for ages the audio stays if still sputtering a bit but the video is completely stopped most of the time i am also playing on a new pixel five so it is not a hardware issue other than that i have been having a lot of fun
4,great game love the visuals and story the game itself is the work of a mastermind i have only one issue the server connectivity network speeds are slow even with strong connectivity in my area i also had issues with the story it hangs up the frame freezes while narrating the story i hope you get rid of this error in future updates please help me if possible i found the missions really interesting the story is very endearing i hope a liter version is provided in the future
4,lovely game the story graphics and combat system are all great the only negatives are the gacha system which you can ignore if you focus on the story instead of collecting and upgrading characters and the immense size of the game i might have to uninstall it because it is just too big the crazy thing is that the game is super slow on a computer so that is not an option either i have to turn the graphics all the way down for it to be playable on my phone and it still crashes sometimes
4,the game is great with bosses loot exploration quests and more but there is an issue this is where the game will be goingi can hear everything and press buttons after a scene or transaction but the loading screen is in the way so you cannot see anything then i have to restart which takes a while to restart if they can fix that bug it would be perfect especially for a new app other than that it is really great and i recommend it
4,genshin impact is visually stunning and breathtaking as a person who is not much of a gamer this made me want to improve my playing skills the story is interesting and the characters are impressive but after every update my phones lag gets worse i had set graphics to the lowest setting and even turned on developer mode on my phones setting re installed the game but it just got worse i really hope this gets fixed because i love this game and can see myself playing it for a longer time
4,the game is overall very fun i love the set up and i think it is a fun challenging addicting game my one main problem is the security factors i think that it would be much safer if the game had a two step authentication system i have lost my account multiple times over and over again i now do not play on mobile and mainly play on playstation you should also let the players bring over account from different devices i had to restart my game just to play on playstation other than this it is good
4,it is great the storylines are great the graphics well done and the characters are well designed the problem i currently have with this is just the fact that i had my graphics set to the lowest setting it still lags in frustration i set it to highest and it still lags but at the same rate maybe even less hopefully you will be able to make this game more compatible with mobile one last thing please give more rewards after a really hard quest really annoying once you get to higher ranks
4,genshin impact is extremely addicting and entertaining and there is always something for you to do or a new quest to receive however sometimes the game becomes extremely laggy and it is frustrating to be honest though that is really my only concern a wonderful game with lots of wonderful storyboards it does become pay to win near the end though which is annoying but for the most part you can get big starting from nothing recommended for those who enjoy games such as toram online and botw
4,i love it one of the best open world games for mobile one problem the audio glitches on android are really bad music is fine most of the time but the tiniest bit of lag which is impossible to avoid on samsung makes the audio cut and come back every second also videos straight up just do not work they will freeze as the messed up audio continues if you are lucky it will unfreeze very later on in the video for a few seconds really ruins the experience sometimes
4,straight forward amazin but i never played such a large game in mobile i have a four gigabyte ramthis will not provide stability to most of the phones usedeventhough it works somewhat for example the dragon cannot be seen while i play it glitches and crashes after five minute or so love the character development environment gameplay add options to custom the gamepads other than that the game is legit love it hoping for improvements in the next update
4,the game is great the world is huge and there is many different character modifications and team modifications that you can do you will never get bored of this game and they are still always rolling out special features and new characters the only negative point i have for this game is the fact that there is no voice chat when playing in cooperative mode and typing while playing is really uncomfortable and difficult the next update also needs to have vehicles
4,fun story and interesting game play controls are a bit awkward especially trying to change your view and move while fighting an enemy also very difficult to make precise movements and trying to pick up stuff while running takes some practice for sure other than the touchscreen controls i am very impressed you can tell this game was developed more for console gaming and then adapted for phones the slight frustration of the controls is worth getting to play it though
4,its so good the graphics the story he characters it is so amazing but i am sad that it is not available for macbook pro and also it takes up so much space i had to put all of my graphics to the lowest in order to run smoothly or my ipad would fry for me when the story is animated it is really laggy and freeze so much which is also a problem but i think it is my internet other than that everything is perfection
4,meticulously crafted and lovingly created the cast has unique characters even if you do not roll gacha the controls are a little harder on mobile as opposed to pc i play both but that is on account of my own dexterity everything is easy to pick up and learn and the open world is gorgeous i love climbing mountains and just staring at scenery after almost half a year the end game is repetitive and there is not much to do you can still appreciate the wonderful scenery and the amazing music
4,ngl the game is amazing the graphics and the story is awesome had not played the game in a while came back the audio was weird it has a odd static robot sound as if the voices were distant or you have headphones plugged in partially i did delete it a few months ago and recently reinstalled it in the beginning of the tutorial the motion was quite chopy but that soon went away and has yet to come back continuing to play the sound slowly gets better for full cutscenes the sound is fine
4,i have not played the game for too long but i am having a problem with the audio it is fuzy and choppy kinda like if you plugged in speakers or headphones halfway i do not have have audio problems with any other apps or games i am not sure if it is something on my end or the game itself other than that the graphics look great and the game runs smoothly
4,it is really a nice game to play i would give it five stars but crashes and bugs happen from time to time everything else is fine it happened during the start of the game the screen freezes the part when there was a dragon it bugged you cannot see properly and every intro crashes or freezes the screen the audio becomes very choppy the only that was working well was the subtitles so i hope you can fix this
4,i love this game i have been obsessed for weeks now the characters are super cute and i am completely invested in the story and the current lantern rite event i love how there is always something to do even if you are in between story and archon quests only gave four stars because of the bugs currently cannot even log in after updating my phones software i get stuck on a loading screen update i have tried uninstalling and reinstalling and i still cannot log in
4,the game is one of the best games i have played and it is free my only pet peeve with it is how you can start a quest without thinking and all of a sudden your stuck with a quest that makes you unable to cooperative i would like for a feature where you can call off quests mainly certain world quests and start them at another time
4,game is good please make use of the jump button because it does not do anything add like jump then attacking in mid air to reach the weakpoints of enemy if you are using melee characters add one hundred twenty fps support improve the smoothness of the game on mid range devices because most of the player do not own a high end devices like me improve the loading speed like when you teleport it takes so much time to load in short my concern is the jump button smoothness and the loading speed love this game ️
4,it was pretty good experience the characters the music and even the world its self in the game was good so far no pay to win or paywall i have seen but the bugs are annoying like animals suddenly levitating when killed or characters suddenly start flashing back and forth when changing characters the changing characters might be my phone but it is annoying since your completely frozen for a good four to five seconds why i am complaining for such a small bug because i keep getting killed when that hapn
4,the game is honestly great the graphics are amazing the experience is awesome there is just one problem the stormterror quest now i do not know if its just me but i cannot get past the last light actuator thing by the time i get two of them in and i finish the last fight i would obviously try to get the thing in but it just disappeared i know its timed but this happened every time just when i step on the plate it disappears but other than that its a great game
4,beautiful open world game love the scenery exploring climbing gliding through the air fighting monsters and leveling is nice too this game gives me a great taste of that for those who enjoy characters with unique abilitys weapons there is a variety free is good however a lot will need to be purchased this is the teams income understandable i have yet to fully explore the vast range of land but i am looking forward to it for free this game is worth a download and some time
4,phenomenal game but it would be even better if we could customise the traveller a bit but furthermore its so awesome surprising really as the game is free with out any ads popping up lots of quests that you can choose from and easy to get the hang of you do not get bored easily sith the different types of characters and the free movement the game give to explore the world
4,whoa it is a great game once you manage to download nearly six gigabyte of it but after that it is an engrossing story with great graphics and nice quests the music is calming would really appreciate if the game takes you know uses more data i have a high speed connection but still the game shows my bandwidth as too slow while other apps load without a pause i do not know how it is how it works but yeah it is a con
4,it is amazing i love the game the graphics and controls are very nice yet after a while maybe a month and a half or so i have ran into an issue as i play on my phone i can only play for around five minutes or so maybe even less and it starts to lag and stutter the ping suddenly skyrocketing and stuff like that i tested my phone out with other games similar and they ran perfectly fine besides that it is still a good game would recommend
4,this game is great i play it on mobile and my only issue is there is not enough room for the attack controls and and using the empty space to rotate the camera so many times i hot the damn attack button when i am just trying to turn the god damn camera oh and i guess the camera angles a lot of the time i think its pinned to close to the character and it causes a bunch of bad angles especially during battles but other than that it is bloody brilliant i recommend it to anyone who likes rpgs
4,the cutscenes lag like no tomorrow and occasionally the game crashes itself but overall i greatly enjoy it my biggest complaints are that for mobile users like myself catching critters is a pain and aimed mode is buggy as all heck and is overall inefficient to use archons save you if there is a timed archery challenge that stated it is a very fun game with dynamic characters and interesting plot lines and i cannot wait for the next story installment
4,amazing game amazing storyline i really like how you added other characters that we can play with during he story and elements we can choose from the only reason i give it a four star is the pc problem the amount of times i had to get out of the game and open it again so it could continue to download is way to much it sometimes even crashed and i would not continue
4,this game is truly stunning and i have loved playing every second of it on pc and ios upon getting a new phone it runs fine but the game is so poorly optimized for some reason on android that it crashes why this needs eight gigabyte of ram for a mobile game i have no clue why i seriously do not want to have to play this on a pc every single time just to play smoothly kindly tweak things so those with less than optimal may be able to enjoy more of this game thank you
4,this game is absolutely one of the best games i have ever played on my phone the open word is amazing the character design and graphics are amazing it gets me hooked into it for hours on end the only two problems that i am experiencing so far is with the game mechanics is that it starts glitching out sometimes it usally happens when a couple of enemies are running or attacking me along with that another one is sometimes the game freezes for a second to two when i am in the middle of combat
4,this is a fun game at the start has a great story line and is beginner friendly though there are a few problems i have which is that after you reach a certain level there are not any more story quest which makes it boring and when you reach a higher level your daily quest gets pretty hard for a freeplay player like me events also get very hard and some of them are annoying i do really like this games but it gets boring because you are just in a loop everyday repeating everything
4,i love the game the story is so smooth and the characters so easy to adore but i have one little complaint i deleted many apps to be able to install this one and still have ten gigabyte free storage in my phone and still when the storyline starts it gets stuck and i can only hear the plot not see it please fix this because i do not think it is my devices problem it is new and works perfectly i love the creators of the game though it is amazing
4,i am loving the game its graphics gameplay and storyline are over all pretty great buti have a few problems when it comes to some cut scenes which are glitchy on the graphics though that could be because of my phone or my signal also i do not know why is it sort of clunky to aim with archers like sometimes i cannot move them to aim at my target or it just moves so slow and very little but it could be just a problem for phone either way if its a bug hope it will be fixed keep up the good work
4,a game i have never been disappointed in although with the huge open world maps high quality graphics and great character designs some people may not like this due to the huge space consumption and frame drop lags for some low end devices like mine it makes my device overheat from time to time but it was worth downloading i would recommend giving the option in the settings to remove some of the special effect and animations to improve performance like when switching characters etc
4,the game is great but there are some things i want to point out lowest resolutions more like medium for me lower the resolution more please when using marksmen i cannot aim buttons are too close to each other four camera angles when in a fight are annoying it always focuses on the grass blocking the fight
4,the only thing i find unpleasant abou this game is how much it takes up storage plus the constant updates wich makes it difficult to adjust other then that great game great graphics great gameplay and easy to understand well not at the start but once you learn the basics your fine there is a chance i will delete the game for a while but i can see myself going back to it
4,this game is so good the graphics the storyline and everything but there is one problem that always bothers me everytime that i will face dvalinstormterror the visual bugs on the screen will show i thought it can be fixed by redownloading the game but when i tried it the visual bug still remains that is why i cannot finish the quest about confronting dvalin please help me devs to fix these visual bug
4,almost everything about this game is great the way the world is open yet it is pretty clear where you need to go to progress the cute character designs plus really pretty graphics only issue is the cutscenes are all janky in some way whether it be freezing on one frame static y audio or both it is really just not pleasant and it sucks because the story is interesting
4,i  really love this game but why i cannot log in after the update using my facebook account how can i fix it
4,to be honest i have not played the game because i hate the mobile controls and my pc is not powerful enough but i do still want to play the game i was just wanting to ask if we could get some mobile controller support edit i have now played the game and i think the game is fantastic graphics are great and how smooth it runs is also great i sometimes have a few issues with the controls but aside from that i think it is well worth the amount of storage it takes up
4,four stars cause it has lot of bugs and glitches and some commissions slow down the game i hope they fix that the most annoying is that you have wait and stand for a few seconds everytime you need to pick up something moreover the graphics are great one more thing the checking for updates things forever soemtimes and the game will not start until i restart the game so please fix that too thanks for reading and giving your time for user reviews
4,the gameplay and the story are truly amazing i only have problems with the game not big problems but if they could be looked at or fixed this game could get more downloads than it does at the moment first problem the controls are a bit too close to each other i often find myself hitting the slash button when climbing or simply just moving the screen around last problem if the game could be optimised a bit for low end devices so that it could run more smoothly it would be epic
4,good game but the version ruined the gameplay for me unlike in the previous version where it was still running smoothly i cannot even play it decently the screen keeps freezing up it is like watching a powerpoint presentation please fix edit the game is running better now but there is no option to update it to v as of writing
4,an issue i hate is the camera angles when i am fighting an enemy i would not want the camera to be at the ground no one wants that the moment i start hitting an enemy it moves automatically and it ruins the experience it should not be moving too much in weird low angles it should prioritize high angles for the fight also recently there have been some issues with the screen freezing it will just freeze not just on my device but for other people i know as well
4,it is a great game with amazing animations but every so often if you do not have enough data or your internet connection plays up a little your phone tablet will start glitching a bit but all you have to do is close the app down turn your device off and wait a while turn your device back on and open the app and it works fine
4,great game beautiful graphics and honestly one of the best soundtracks i have heard in a mobile game there is a few things that annoy me can be very laggy i am on a pixel you cannot exit the app for more than five seconds before it crashes and you have to close and re open it very frustrating especially if you want check a text or a wiki page
4,one of the best games on my phone the gameplay is the most fun aspect to me because of the element physics and its pretty fun to experiment with it especially since the devs give you five characters quickly the history of the world being able to be found in books is a great idea since its choice the only problem i have is that the loot takes so long to appear and i have to tap it slowly for it register which is undeniably annoying because i grind instead of shopping not that its needed to buy
4,fun and great game to play have been playing since the beginning and it is an amazing open world adventure wish the characters were more customizable but i still love the characters in the story but having major bugs with the game now i sent an email to customer service no reply edit new update fixes the bugs so i can play again but i missed out on so many quests and rewards raised my rating to four stars
4,i was skeptical at first but i fell in love with this game right away but i am a mobile player and the controls and camera are just not as friendly for us i currently do not have any archer characters in my party ever because it is too easy to die while aiming due to having to adjust the camera constantly with no fine movement controls also the audio is crackling and sounds really distorted following the latest android samsung software update please fix this i love it overall
4,gameplay is fun and addictive i am absolutely obsessed with this game however my only complaint is that the game continues to freeze and sometimes crash during major fights and the game will usually freeze for up to three minutes it gets really frustrating on boss levels especially the ruin guards and ley line openings please make a feature where the game will automatically pause when the app freezes
4,it has its glitches but a stunning game nonetheless i also think that more supplies should be given in chests or dropped such as ore and materials to make equipment also think the map should be more precise there are areas or places i am trying to find that probably should show up on it otherwise it is a fun game with awesome characters
4,i really love this game but be warned this game is huge i am lucky i have space the characters are not bad and some are even charming in their own ways and the graphics are great i recommend turning them down a bit if your phone is not a beast though my only problem is the audio glitch i have been experiencing i have a note nine and it was running fine till the update the audio often will be distorted at random and it made me sad that i could not understand characters sometimes
4,the graphics are absolutely gorgeous the characters the voice acting the adventure storyline music everything is amazing the only reason why i rated it four stars was because of slight audio problems and glitching as well as camera problems my camera sometimes moves in one direction without me touching anything or the audio cuts out briefly regardless i highly recommend this game i play on mobile so it is a bit laggy but i am assuming that is normal you should definitely play
4,i like the system easy to understand not too many functions but the story after stormbreaker seems boring well i am still below level forty so still a long way to go to finish the story i kind a do not like the default controller setting if you could allowed me to customise the button eg move attack button lower abit move the jump button upper a bit and so on i think it will be great
4,september right now i am playing on a samsung galaxy ten set on high performance to make sure i can play this game although since yesterday things were going well without issue but as of now i am struck in the first town because of the cutscene lagging and freezing along with audio turning to static and pops and the worse part of this is when i think that cutscene is over it loops back and replays it over again update september it seems to be working now after uninstalling and reinstalling it
4,it is a nice game with stellar graphics i cannot say much about it yet it is a little laggy at times the thing i find super annoying is how i had to purge everything on my phone in order to have enough space to play this i hope it comes out for the switch soon because i would really like to play it on that and prevent my phone from exploding because of how much gigabyte this game requires
4,good game but it takes way to long to start also the downloading of all the things that it needs takes hours and if for some reason it stops then it have to do the downloading from the start due to the very slow way for the game to start i have not been able to play much but from what i have played is one of the most amazing games combining rpgs and gachas so i nevertheless enjoyed the game i do not know if the problems i mentioned only happened to me if so it is ok but please fix them thanks
4,amazing game great graphics and easy controls needs some work here and there cooperative mode needs some work to allow players to assist each other in not just daily commissions but also regular story missions if they have anything in common or for example side quests when playing cooperative mode i cannot even view my missions and every domain i try cannot be played in multiplayer mode also the game should have controller input support or have control mapping because it makes it easier for many players
4,game played great initially when running well characters and actions are fluid however there are some performance issues some easy performance wins would be to reduce the amount of grass reduce objects visual in distance and tone down special effects i think there is just too much being rendered at the same time it also feels like the internet connection causes game lag if connection is poor the game seems to stutter this feels like a weird design choice
4,it is a really good game story gameplay graphics are all really good the one problem is lag during all the major cutscenes the game lagged horribly the audio cut out and like frames per second i hope this gets fixed but that is really the only problem i have had with the game
4,ive only started playing genshin probably like a couple weeks or so and i absolutely love it the storyline side quests open world exploring the characters etc its just all amazing but i am having a bit of trouble with the audio and it seems like i am not the only one experiencing it the music seems to lag and its static y but when use the menu when you click on piamon next to map the audio seems fine hopefully the issue is resolved and i would love to give you guys the five stars
4,the game is good the art the world and voice over everythings great just needs a lot of optimization on android the on screen controls could have been customisable playing at sixtyfps on sd eightfifty five drains the battery in just a few minutes and heats up the phone like crazy just fix that and this will be great game to play on mobile
4,overall the gameplay is fantastic the fighting mechanics is so well polished and unique good storyline good voice acting soundtracks etc what i do not like about it is the resin system and the way on how you level up your characters currently i am arfour i played for a month now after reaching adventure rank thirty and when you have maxed all statues and collected all chests there nothing much to do anymore because if you need to progress you need resins which is very slow to regenerate
4,a great free to play adventure rpg wth captivating exploration interesting story and customizable characters the combat combos keeps me experimenting and engaged one drawback is as of the four characters i have unlocked there is no block i can always dodge but sometimes when i am by a cliff or edge it throws me off literally and figuratively lastly there is no support for my wireless controllers but other than that a great game to play and get lost in four five
4,i would give this game five stars because of the picturesque sceneries cute and semi realistic animation cool fighting and exploring scenes etc but the rock climbing is so difficult that it takes me an hour to go to a certain place also the camera angle moves in the midst of fighting so it is kinda annoying that i cannot see anything but grass and stuffs but despite those problems i would definitely recommend this game
4,to be fair to the game it really really is beautiful the graphics the open world the character and monster designs the weapons and their effects attack animations everything about the game is breathtakingly beautiful my only problem with it is that to appreciate the beauty of the game i unfortunately do not have a phone or pc with the ability to let the game run as smoothly as i wish it could based on the ads and other promos thank you for the beautiful game though hahaha
4,amazing game i like the colours the vibe the style and story probably not the first time you guys heard this but its just that the lack of content maybe its because some story quests are too short and give too little rewards the resin system feels too little or too low another would be the events are a little boring also anothe problem would be chest respawns the problem is that they do not
4,i love this game and how everything is so clean and smooth it is definitely worth playing with an asterisk playing on phone is more hindering and is definitely not how to play it the phone screen is too too small to really enjoy the visuals and the controls leave much to be desired for that platform i think i want gonna move to pc and that will be how i play
4,overall concept of this game is very simple and complex at the same time graphics are stunning so many things to explore through adventure boss fights are extremely difficult still i think developers can create little bit of balance in hero characters it will be extremely hard for anyone to defeat world level bosses without at least one five star character i am facing same difficulty as i do not have one yet
4,this game is great the graphic is very well made the plot is not bad either and i really like the power system in this game is quite unique and interesting the control is smooth and all the characters is so beautiful especially lisa however the game always crash after playing for or hours i do not really mind it cause i just took a short break when ever it crash but there might be a player that will find it really annoying and frustrating so try to fix that overall i give it four star
4,the game is great storyline is amazing graphics is outstanding minor issues and bugs but that is okay for a new game my issue is the bug i encountered on stormbearer point i fell off the cliff and tried to open my adventure book to locate my next boss but the game glitched and i was stuck unable to do anything for a while hope this bug gets fixed other than that this is an really great game
4,the game is great it has possibly the best graphics i have ever seen in a game on mobile however there are certain issues to improve within my limited time with this game i have experienced that there are bugs in the user interface i select an item and the hovering animation is there but it just does not open it is a bug so i think you guys need to improve your touch detection i was quite irritated by it i have not found any faults otherwise yet
4,great game with some improvments left to be desired please add native controller support key mapping to the mobile version adding auto item pick up even if only for drop items would help a lot too the game is improving in the right direction and it will hopefully easier for casuals to finish dailies in less time while offer enough for devoted to do before five hit somewhere middle of next year
4,i love that this game has a breath of the wild vibe to it but a better feeling than that i would give it five stars but i feel that the performance requirements outstrip the current mobile technology for those that cannot afford the brand new phones or tablets the cut scenes keep freezing and the gameplay is quite choppy i will have to get it for pc if i want to play it properly also i cannot seem to find the options to change the movement style the user interface size nor the options to change the vo style
4,decent device recommended but not unplayable on a lower performance platform make sure you have six or so gigabyte space in your storage drains battery pretty quickly especially on higher settings otherwise such a game being available to mobile is impressive visuals and combat are great rich storyline with complete and passionate voicing requires you to level up a bit before being able to play with friends
4,overall great game the graphics are beautiful the characters are pretty cool the world is just masterfully built however i have my complaints to start off the resin system is atrocious workable but atrocious its constantly just trying to stay afloat and running out very quickly the gameplay gets extremely repetitive adventure rank twenty plus however that is understandable as only two of the seven over eight regions have been released so the other content is gonna take a bit seriously though the resin system is bad
4,i have been playing for a few days so far its a great game its an rpg that makes me wish it was an mmo it has a huge map to explore quests etc the thing missing though is people running around mmo style and pvp this game has great potential fantastic sound great graphics very fun play elemental stuff sounds complicated at first but for me hands on helped a lot
4,this is a fantastic game from the characters combat and story but i wish for us mobile players we could have controller support built in like use a xbox controller and such that is why its a four over five otherwise five over five game if it gets included edit also would be nice if you could lock weapons and artifacts so you do not use them for enhancement and the resin system needs an overhaul one reason every eight minutes when at least you need twenty resin to do things that is really bad
4,it is a great game with good graphics it is just that it is a bit choppy with the graphics since i have a four gigabyte ram phone the storage it takes too is six gigabyte would be an improvement for the game to be open to more people that has small storage space left i would also suggest it to work on making it more smoother for four gigabyte phone since it is a bit choppy as i said
4,this game is absolutely incredible i adore the art and gameplay even the story though very realistic on anime tropes is good and i adore the characters however i do want to bring up that at the end of the day this is a gatcha game the gatcha mechanics can be extremely frustrating and i still fully believe that the resin system needs reformed to make cooperative more of a staple there is also a drop off in content once you put in enough hours but i assume that will get better along the way
4,i think this game is really well made especially since i am running it on a phone it has great graphics great game play and a great story i have only just started but it seems to be almost exactly like legend of zelda breath of the wild the part where you need to go to different monuments to unlock your map your stamina system the part where you start the game and you are on a cliff overlooking hyrule and even the way you get your glider
4,the graphics gameplay and controls are outstanding i rated this four stars becauase of this bug the game constantly closes from time to time their are not issues with my device storage space as well as my ram but i still cleared alot of space to see if that is the cause of the problem but sadly no even though i have cleared a large amount of space even cleared cache it still closes from time to time which can be very annonying i hope you fix the bug and if you do i will be sure to change my rate
4,the game was exceptional with a beautiful open world and lots to do my personal favourite is using my glider the quests are very satisfying the cooking system is a bit too oversimplified i would say i kind of wished they would let us choose what element we want though at the getgo our character chooses anemo at least mine did controls are smooth story is a bit generic but not cliché the battle system is exciting and fun and the whole thing feels breath of the wild definitely worth it
4,it is an awesome game and the animation is amazing as well the only thing that is annoying is when you want to change party members having to click so many things is bothersome it would be nice to have a fast feature that once you click an arrow or something you can have the other four party members in an instant one more thing is when wanting to pick something up you have to stand there for a while until it lets you pick it up but over all good gameplay and cute characters
4,it is mostly wonderful the animation is beautiful and it has a great story my only issues are some bugs with the visuals and some of the mechanics outside of the main city most of the ground turns black making it harder to find things you would get from battles and such when it comes to mechanics it can be difficult to continuously move using the joystick and control while gliding is a bit touchy as well otherwise a fantastic game that does not make spending money the main goal
4,while i think the paid features are a bit expensive the basic experience of this game is phenomenal you get a full rpg with solid gameplay and stunning graphics for free the experience going between my pc and phone is really impressive as well progress synchronizes instantly too i will say the cooperative being so highly level locked was also disappointing
4,i like this game so much i really do it is quite entertaining and all and it is got me hooked the problems that i got however are the loading times when you boot up the game are quite long i suppose that is to be expected but the one thing that bugs me the most is that some cut scenes will not show out like the starting cut scene or the cut scene where you fly to shoot the stormterror please fix this
4,this game is a must play the graphics are clean and controls are simple enough the reason why i gave four stars is that your phone quickly gets hot and the battery drains fast there is also some server lag if you go though an area with lots going on like cities i have only have played for an hour so i will edit my review once i experience more of the game
4,i love it its so good and engaging the controls are simple very responsive the graphics and the views are breathtaking i absolutely love it i have minor issues sometimes with the story times where the screen freeze but i can still listen to it i am not sure if is my phone or the game but to be honest does not bother me because does not happen during the game play only story times overall is an amazing game for a mobile game
4,mobile version is not too great imo but the pc version is really good but mobile version it has lots of framerate issues even on really low settings and the touch controls feel awkward and are hard to use but this is definitely a platform problem i can play max settings fourk on my pc and the controls are super easy to use there i did not expect much from a free game but it delivers on what the ads promised unlike many other games from little known developers quite fun
4,the game is really fun and flashy but the speed at which you earn premium currency is extremely slow as well as it being overpriced if you buy it with real money but i never feel i need to spend money to progress as it only unlocks new characters to play as so i am not that upset as for how the app runs on mobile is a different question i have a note eight imo that is a pretty new device unfortunately the game crashes often and constantly suffers from frame rate drops and performance issues
4,the game is so good the storyline gameplay everything is perfect but in the loading screen it stops at snowflake and does not move at all i kept it like that for ten minute and still no progress i really want to complete this game it seems few other people are also having this problem after reading the forums the app developers please look into this problem
4,the best game that i have played so far there some major issues with it though especially the optimisation towards my phone my phone has eight gigabyte of ram and still struggles to render the world a lot of problems come with it characters faces going invisible buildings disappearing mobs not loading other than the game runs pretty smooth on my phone i am hoping the developer fixes this bug on the next update
4,for a brand new game it is really well done with only a few hiccups here an there the controls need some tuning for example adding a button for climbing would be nice also disabling the automatic camera movement would be really nice and being able to turn off auto target would be great but otherwise this game is wonderful
4,game is very fun and graphics are gorgeous wish it was easier to get the currency for the gatchas by gathering but i understand that is how they are making money since the game is free otherwise controls on the phone are a bit awkward i feel the touch joystick is too far towards the center of the screen if it was the floating style that centered where you touched the screen in the bottom left corner it would be better i mainly play this on pc anyways so not a huge deal for me
4,the only complaint i have for the graphics is that i have a crazy powerful phone that tanks this game like it is nothing i would like to see the graphics option allow for distant object to still render as it would on pc or playstation something like a fourfortyp upscale would be cool but i am not sure but i believe that is a thing already controller support needs to be a thing too all in all its a beautiful world and the story is so far well crafted great work keep at it
4,amazing game one of the best currently on mobile my only complaint is the controls the button layout and sensitivity of turning is not up to par for things you need to do in game this results in a lot of falling or attacking mid glide and ruining travel or a large climb i may start playing on pc till this is fixed
4,at first i have never played a game like this but man it gave a good first impression and i love playing it right now the ability to choose how the game looks through the graphics customizer is a very good touch great gameplay a little descriptive on how things work but you start to understand quickly and simplify it in your own way only problem is that sometimes the cutscenes freeze and the audio kinda splices itself and i cannot make out what it says like a cd skipping great game guys
4,everything is amazing in this game the only thing i really hope they would improve on is the enhancement system as someone who looks for the best offensive stat and substat it would be really helpful to know which of my artifacts i am actually using as fodder currently i have to navigate back and forth between the enhancement screen and the list of artifacts there is no popup while hovering the item to tell you the artifacts detail when selecting in the enhancement screen
4,fantastic game love playing it on the pc however running on my snine was painful even after turning all the graphic options to low or off was hoping to use this as a way to complete my dailies while away from home but in its current state i do not think its feasible really hoping the devs find a way of allowing us mobile users to reduce graphics a little more to allow for smoother gameplay maybe reduce the view distance or perhaps remove some of the grass and leaf effects on trees
4,everything about the game is great from the graphics to the performance absolutely stunning and smooth for the first day or two after release even after i get rid of all my background tasks and using game launcher and on lowest settings my twenty plus still gets uncomfortably hot this should not be happening on a top of the line phone please optimise the game the temperature is causing the rest of the game to throttle leading to frame stutter and lag as well
4,the games is really well made most scenes are voice acted so you do not have to read paragraphs to understand the lore it looks great and i have not experienced many glitches besides some movement issues after playing a few hours but you cannot expect much from a game with touch screen mechanics overall i give the game a eight eight out of ten consideringits free my oppion may change later
4,this is one if the most visually impressive mobile games i have ever played its a really well put together story and the combat is very smooth the one thing that slightly bugs me as a zelda fan is that this is blatantly a copy of breath of the wild the game mechanics shrines temples enemies etc are basically ripped right from botw what saves the game is that it is a great copy so it a does not bug me much because its so fun to play and feels like playing botw on mobile which is great
4,this is a great game and i think its even better as a mobile game as compared to a console game because the menu navigation is much faster and easier when you can touch the screen i do however wish there was an option to use a controller because the game runs hot and i do not want to touch the screen the whole time just when doing menu stuff like inventory and cooking and stuff
4,this game is phenomenal and i do not want to put it down it is a bit of a battery drain but for the amount of game that your phone is rendering put the charger on and go at it the graphics are wonderful the music is amazing the ai is challenging but not unbeatable especially at lower levels the characters are super balanced and the damage is weight y my only complaints with the game are that it needs bluetooth controller specifically playstation controller and to increase the exp dropped
4,did not think a mobile game could be that good that said there are a few annoying things that i wanna point out first there is no way to set waypoints to locations unless its an objective or mission second when setting a waypoint through map to a place that is not an actual mission like ley lines it does not show the way there it just highlights it on the minimap if those features get added this is definitely a five star game even if not its still a really fantastic experience for mobile
4,cannot get past loading screen update i figured out that you can get past only if you login in the first screen it is bad design as they allow you to close the login screen which makes it seem like optional if you close it though the next screen just hangs without an indication of what went wrong after playing the game a bit i can say that this seems like a promising game pretty much everything i saw was similar to zelda breath of the wild which is a venerable game
4,the overall story is good the effort is great but the graphics and overall performance is quite a bummer since i have started playing sound is quite choppy and nothing but black screen when i watch cut scenes i wish you would include some settings where we can remove unnecessary animations like grass movement water reflection and more
4,the game works well and the graphics are great however there seem to be glitches in the cut scenes where the screen freezes from time to time and there is no way to customize the on screen controls i have been playing for days and iaps do not seem to be mandatory i have already unlocked of the additional characters without spending a cent
4,awesome game with a surprising amount of depth to it feels close to a high quality non mobile game the audio could use some work to make it feel more polished voices are too spammy in combat and music is somewhat forgettable or often not mixed well in terms of volume add controller support and allow the camera distance to be permanently set if you have any interest at all in rpgs there is nothing to lose as a free to play experience hopefully mobile games begin to go this design route
4,really impressive game some of the mechanics are a bit clunky and awkward on mobile but if i get stuck something that is to hard on my phone i just mark it on my map and do them on my pc later so far i have been completely free to play and the game is completely playable with the free stuff so far i am adventure level and have yet to hit any sort of pay wall not relevant to the mobile version but i do hope they allow us to customize our key bindings for pc in a future patch
4,probably the best open world exploration experience you can have on mobile this game takes a lot of influence from series such as zelda and nier and if you enjoy both titles you will feel right home here it is far from perfect star for the inclusion of microtransactions which of course makes the game pay to win i wish this was limited to cosmetics and convenience items only also wish there would be some customization options for the main playable character skins outfits ect
4,honestly it is a decent game the story timeline design and overall gaming experience are excellent as well as the scenes and effects however it is loading takes a long time every time you start the game and the glitching is sometimes really annoying but overall it is a great game
4,the game looks gorgeous and there is so much to do it really gives a feeling of a full world to explore as playing on a phone the controls are to be acquainted with the moving stick might get you turning around instead of having clear movement but i guess that can be learned better with more playing i will review this later on as still am on the way to understand the game better
4,this game is phenomenal graphics are incredible gameplay is nicely packed and the story is intriguing however this is just me but i would like more abilities not like more classes like air and water but more ways to use them each character does have their own set of abilities but adding more would make this game so much for strategy intense and fun some powers can be weaker than others at some points and some may just give a small boost
4,almost perfect in my opinion only setbacks being the lack of control customization controller support and most importantly how it heats up my device by a lot its a galaxy ten so not too low in the settings department to the point where i fear for the longevity of my phone if i keep playing even though i am doing so in the lowest settings possible for the game other than that yes it checks all the boxes of an awesome game
4,i love both the game and the story but the lag just makes the game near unplayable at times the game completely freezes for a goodten over tenseconds and rare times even longer if there is some way to fix this every setting is on low lowest please let me know great game
4,the gameplay and visuals are phenomenal slot better than what you would expect out of a mobile game the story seems interesting too and so are the characters however there are a few problems i have faced in my time with the game first being that it can be a little repetitive and grindy and that the drop rates for certain characters are a bit too low outside of those two small criticisms everything else seems to be just fine
4,game play feels very familiar if you have played zelda botw but by no means are these the same i would give five stars for sure if the cinematics did not freeze up but at least it still moves onto the game after the cinematics allotted length also climbing is a bit off at times it will refuse to climb some objects or places unless my camera is perfectly aligned with it then at other times i am climbing a wall before i knew it and lost what i was chasing around the corner still an awesome game
4,the game is exceptional it is like being in a console world using my phone although it does feel like having a console in my phone coz ot cannot keep up with the graphics i do wish there were some way they could loosen up the background or some way to loosen the graphics so that my gigabyte ram phone can handle it but it truly is an exceptional game i love the fact that i do not see other players too makes it feel more personal
4,i have just started playing the game and i think it is really good i just have one request i wish that you guys could add a setting to change the graphics like the blurring and all can be changed to a preference since it kinda lags and glitches out my screen edit i noticed you can only change the graphics at a certain point i watched on youtube please change that i have to slug with all the lag to get to that point
4,good rpg game reminds me of breath of the wild big time then witcher skyrim and sword art online honestly i am curious how the story is since i am visually comparing it to those games i just got to the first city but could not play anymore due to glitches and constant freezing even restarting the app and phone did not help story seems good so far four stars because constant glitching which takes away from the experience controls seem alright takes getting used to
4,this game is incredibly beautiful it is easily an addicting game with storytelling quests foraging cooking leveling up of characters and weapons in my opinion this game is like an anime adaption of breathe of the wild and skyrim rolled into one my only issue is the controller circle it is awkward with my small hands to smoothly control the direction of my character an option to customize where the controls are located would be much better so that i can move and fight better please
4,pretty good i have only played the intro but its very smooth and the controls are pretty good there were a few audio glitches where there was static sound and a few cutscenes froze up but i am sure these bugs will be patched out i also wish there was an option to rescale some of the buttons as the buttons on the top of the screen are just way too small it would also be nice if the controls supported gyroscope aiming especially for the bow otherwise though i have really enjoyed it
4,this game has me hooked i try to play whenever i have down time i plan on playing alot once the weekend comes i only have two complaints a darker joy stick on the screen would be nice i am not visually impared and its a little hard to see download was unbearable it took all night on my phone and i had to keep restarting the download on my tablet
4,i am playing on my pixel and it runs smoothly and beautifully the game is very bright and colourful refreshing and it looks like a really well done game my issues are the controlling can be utterly annoying sometimes and the sound after a few minutes the sound goes all glitchy and horrible i wanted this game on the switch what a massive let down when there is not even news of when it will come out so i can fully enjoy this game on a portable console where you can control things properly
4,the game is amazing and i would have given a full five stars for everything but during gameplay i have encountered two times when it would just freeze and the game would stop working therefore making me restart it for it work properly again besides this problem i have not encountered any other problem in the gameplay graphics or any other sort of bugs hopefully the team can fix this bug i have not reached far into the storyline yet so the fact that it happened twice already means its a problem
4,great i love it i love how intuitive the element system is the great artstyle and music and the exploration is perfect i did have some gripes about the preformance there are some issues during cutscenes and frames can drop during fights i also have a lot of connection issues as i reconnect often although i do not know if that is simply an issue on my end or with the game my last issue is the game is it is limited in platform choice as i am unable to get this game on my tablet four five
4,great game the only problem that is why i rated this four stars is because if you minimize the game for example you are going to read a messege or text and then you are going back to the game it will restart the game but the graphics gameplay story and others are good i hope you can do something about the idle time
4,game is pretty great all around gameplay is fun although is not quite as intuitive as i would like and can often be finicky between switching characters mid combat and picking up bugs and fish game looks great and has a large open world to explore my only real gripe with the game is it is gacha system i realise the game is free to play and the devs need some way to turn a profit but the rates of the higher rarity characters is absurdly low and currency is just too scarce in game
4,the game is absolutely gorgeous to look at and the voice over and music feels really polished as well however from my initial impression i think i can suggest some improvments the charecter movement in the open feels somewhat slow an increase in the base movement speed would be nice or an artifact that increases the movement speed is also welcomed archer class needs an auto aim lock feature an option to force sixtyfps would also be nice four control reposition option would be great
4,the game is amazing beautiful graphics cool characters and a great story i do have some problems though i feel it is too much because i have to play with a charger plugged in and it still loses battery the cutscenes freeze no matter what quality i am on my biggest problem in game is the adventure rank leveling up it takes hours to level it up just one level and the ratio between the amount you get from doing things is a little off
4,the music the world the graphics everything is beautiful and goes so well together there is a story but it does not get showed down your throat instead you can choose yourself to learn more about the characters books foods enemies and weapons everything just goes so well exept the cutsenes and button placement playing this on a phone with good internet connection the cutsenes will not work at all the video will not play and the adio lags
4,this game took mobile gaming in to the next level i really love the graphics but a few cons from my personal experience my network is pretty good but i am getting red ping sometimes the fps drops and gets a bit laggy regarding the controls if it was possible to adjust the placement of keys it would hav been nice i kind of needed active cooperative missions dungeons world boss etc i do not know if it is waiting ahead because i am writing this after two days of game play
4,one star is missing because of one gigantic problem is that the left analog virtual joystick does not appear where you touch instead it is fixed into one position which makes for a lotta errors in a game with such precision required this is unacceptable the modern virtual joystick appears where you touch and then you move your finger in a direction to move this fixed analog feels very primitive otherwise this game is a marvel get it
4,this is a great game the development team should be proud my biggest issues with the game are the joystick placement to move the character should adjust to where the player first puts their finger then the player can drag from that new location many other apps have this feature and its is a quality of life improvement the app needs controller support the game is available on playstation so just let those with a playstation or xbox controller use that interface other than that great work
4,the graphics is good and the quality of the game is really great and i would really love to play this game the developers really did a great job for this the only problem is it is unplayable in mobile devices with gigabyte ram whenever i interact with the npcs it just crashes still i managed to get to the secrete pirate treasure quest but that is where my journey ended this game is really great and i still hope that the developers can find a way to fix the problem
4,breath of the wild meets diablo graphics are amazing gameplay loop is fun and addicting only issue is controls no controller support and even if they add it they need to allow remapping of the controlls on pc playing on controller is atrocious it looks like the dev never played anything on a controller and just assigned the controlls randomly to the buttons
4,beautiful game from one look it is just another fantasy rpg but the story is actually very entertaining and the game mechanics have features that do not exist in any another rpg you will see what i mean the only issue i have is with the aiming i find it hard to position my crosshair carefully as the screen is very wobbly would you please add an aim assist feature the helps players find their targets slightly without being an aimbot thanks
4,so far i am loving this game this is a console level video game experience on my phone and the shop has not been intrusive enough to make me feel like i am forced to spend money to enjoy myself my only problem so far is that some times the game boots up in portrait mode instead of landscape and i have to restart multiple times to change it back if this can be fixed thisll be a five star game for me
4,i am not too far in so i guess it might still be ruined but this is the best game on the app store after minecraft hands down the combat feels incredibly fluid and works pretty damn well on a touchscreen the graphics are really pretty and definitely pushing what phones can display the movement albeit a little flawed feels more than good enough and the open world works well the music is great but the implementation needs work the open world is a bit closed off which i do not love
4,this game is if not the best game on the phone it is definitely one of the best games i seen a lot of games getting graphically good recently but none like this it has a lot of breath of the wild mechanics but it is still so different from it that it becomes it is own thing only issue i noticed so far is there is no controller support although the touch controls are still good just wish i could use a controller and if they add that support i would give five stars but for now it is four stars for me
4,gameplay is one of the most fun experiences i have ever had and graphics are of amazing quality that i have never seen before in a mobile game however i have an issue where the cutscenes tend to always freeze and crash the game where i have to restart the game constantly if this issue is fixed this will on the top of my list for the best mobile game to play on the app store
4,i do not know if i am the only one who immediately notices this but the game is basically a copy of legend of zelda breath of the wild from the graphics atmosphere open world etc to game mechanics such as stamina climbing and swimming find and cook food for buffs wind gliders enemy camps teleport towers that unlock maps but hey botw is a legendary game and it is on mobile shamelessly to say i think this is fine regardless i still have to rate four stars due to obvious reasons
4,the interface feels more natural to navigate on mobile than pc but the combat controls are lacking additionally there does not seem to be an option for gamepad controls on mobile despite the pc client supporting them otherwise the game runs fluidly on a relatively high end device with plenty of content and relatively impressive graphics
5,i have been playing for a year and a half now this game is reakky good and all but today i just encounter a problem which i cannot log in my account through facebook it keep showing something went wrong please fix this hoyo i want my account back
5,graphics is very good and story line is best

5,i love this game and it is story the only thing that i would say is a bad thing id say is the prices for the digital currency
5,this game is so good i love it but why it takes so long to open every update i want to play can genshin impact makes the five star comes faster there is people who do about one hundred pull for only one five star character but the character in the banner like ganyu xiao venti eula yea miko and raiden thank you for reading this and i wish if genshin impact player see the same and thank you again for genshin impact

5,in fact the game is amazing is one of my favorites games can wait for the realease of furina overall the quest lore gaming experience feels amazing best game so far
5,good game like the story line you can do what you want in the middle or the quest as it does not force you to walk a path and head straight to the quest area
5,please increase the zoom out in the map please it getting too big for the mobile screens

5,i like the game though the game can be quite laggy sometimes but it does not bother me in any way keep up the great work
5,i really loved the game but only one thing that i did not like is that when i complete everything i have no quests left and i do not know what to do thanks cookie
5,great game with a lot of different types of characters how do you all even know how to design characters in a way that we all love ah
5,i have always been hesitant to play this game even though i have wanted to for a long time now that i have a new phone with a butt load of storage i am finally able to play and i regret not downloading it sooner
5,the game is good but the update was hava a lot of ads puffing and my app keep loading from the start and still puffing the ads that will make me irratateable
5,when can this game be put on the switch i will love that and i lost my account and had to start over i mean i do not mind but i had made it so far and unlocked so meny characters
5,amazing love the setting characters the lore of course gameplay is smooth on the computer i use now it had to be a eight hundred dollars sixteen ram tb space computer though or it would not really run smoothly on others or it would not work at all but other then that it is a really great game there is no voice distortion in the cutscenes either like their other game honkai star rail
5,the game is very great i would highly recommend playing it because the story is great and the graphics are ok but honestly it is free
5,i play on phone and playstation it is seems to be a great game so far allot of grinding the typical rpg game with a few new refreshing mechanics

5,one of the best free to play game which is truly cross platform and that has a really good story detailed characters impressive controls great audio and visuals of course there are bugs and glitches with any new update but they get resolved sooner or later also the game is unforgiving on low to mid tier spec phones edit the games still the same for me more or less but seriously needs optimization with increasing updates lags and stutters are awfully annoying
5,game is so nice but one problem game not open fast i am open the game the loading is very slow some time game fast open but some time the take a time to open fix the problem pls
5,can you improve the artifact farming system because this thing makes many player losing interest playing if i say so my self i am one of those
5,it is so fun and the characters were so cool i mean i find it boring at first because of fighting with some strong opponents but i got used to it

5,too good games with the amazing graphics and visuals feels like in an anime world
5,the game is fun and all but it is too heavy like the game folder ones i downloaded the game i lost thirty gigabyte storage which is a lot
5,i really in love with this game its cool game full of adventure and fighting even though that is my type
5,hello please solve my problem it will take a few days when i enter the game it crashes and crashes and my phone memory is twenty giga empty my phone model is sharp aquos rfive giga
5,the best experience yet but is not there any way to reduce the soze of this game it is a bit concerning as it occupies around seven gigabyte of storage
5,winning is really hard and mostly get a five star only by pity need to save up so much and play for hours if you want to get your fav five star
5,i am happy one of genre that i like so i enjoy the game of course is consuming a lot of time but it is my choice
5,this game rus smoothly on my device it has no errors or bugs in it this is a great game
5,the game is good but is has some problems like some characters are just bad or not good no skip button and not alot of good rewards
5,this game is awesome the open world game lets you do all kinds of stuff the character are well written and it runs smoothly in my phone the game optimisation is very well done but it is too large
5,update it is been some time now since i started this game and i still love it however the only thing i hate the most is there garcha system i do not mind paying money to get what i want or at least try to however if you draw an extra and already have it maxed out you do not get your spin your points or currency of anykind it just disappears that is not how you treat your player base yet another thing to top it off the system does not offer a character choose option at least offer one a month
5,great characters and mechanics for adventuring and wandering in the expansive world of teyvat my daughter and i really enjoy this game
5,i love the game and the art my only problem is with worshipping the statues
5,graphics are awesome and that story style is too good english dubbed that not too bad but japanese dubbed voices are so my awesome and that gives a anime life vibes
5,graphics are very very good and the variety of characters that you can choose in between
5,this was a great game i meet a lot of people that help me it was a great time but all things gotta end my storage was low so j gotta quit playing but stillten over tengame
5,i have gotten really far in this game and i gave to say it is amazing it is free to play friendly and it is just the right amount of challenging
5,i love genshin impact the whole plot is great the music and visuals are amazing as well not only that the characters within the game have their own unique story and style the different regions that you can visit throughout the story are so interesting to explore the visuals on phone are not the best but other than that i would like to say it is a really good game that has a couple of flaws i would recommend playing one hundred percent
5,super great game full of arts i wish i can destroy everything like gta san andress and can hurt civilian and can play with more than people like ragnarok
5,fast customer support and problem resolution within four hours i am glad this app made my day and its graphics are amazing thanks genshin impact

5,i love open world games especially with a cool storyline to go with it it is a fun experience and i love it so much
5,everything is fine but i want wishes and primo so i can get a fifty fifty on neuvilette but the thing is i do not have many of them zero wishes and one hundred fifty one primo and i also wanted neuvilette and wriothesley so bad please help us genshin players
5,seriously i have enjoyed this game since i started playing it the downloads are super worth it when you enter the real game highly suggested if you like adventurous games
5,good game but make sure you pack a lunch top tier game and takes the memory for it
5,same types of monsters all over the map i feel i am in one location with little changes no large difference on the whole map

5,i have not showered for a month did not touch grass since i started playing i have no friends and my pare nots do not love me anymore but this game is awesome and i highly recommend
5,this is so adventurous game and interesting plot but the only problem is the teleport way is so many my suggestions is remove the other teleportion and make a transportations like horse
5,i have been playing genshin for over a year now it is such am amazing game the stories are well writen the new lands they add are just great and always adds new things such as puzels and new stories it is just great
5,a really good game there is no flaws in storytelling the bosses are thrilling but not too sweaty and the gameplay is overall incredible
5,i like how we can get characters by doing quests how we can get new weapons and all the stuff we can do to get our characters stronger and make wishes
5,very good game and graphics animation is high level in this game detailing is very good phone like pc
5,the game is stunning and the graphics and the vast open world is really detailed and have a beautiful character with beautiful storyline genshin is the most beautiful mmo rpg game that i can ever find
5,cannot actually believe this game is free thoroughly enjoying it and there does not seem to be a pay wall in sight definitely recommend
5,it beautiful the places but my only problem is that there is some glitch that made it hard to play sometimes
5,this is the best open world game you can travel and see other players it like you are in real world like anime series being isekai everything in this game is so good
5,best rpg mobile adventure game ever i love the graphics and the storyline is the best cannot stop playing
5,really the best open world rpg i have ever played i played it for fourmonths now i am adventure rank fifty five the best open world experience i had in this game
5,best open world game ever i like the story and gameplay is very good in mobile games this is the best game for mobile players
5,was controller gameplay removed in pretty sure i played this game while my playstation controller was bluetooth connected or am i wrong about being able to use my playstation controller
5,very free to play friendly game because the gacha has a guarantee system sure money can buy progress but not necessarily important
5,when first looked at this thinking cool only hundred megs to download seven giga on mobile device well worth it open world like for mobile is a bonus keep up good work devs
5,i am giving it five stars for some reason but i am confused if a muslim can play this could you add a way to skip worshiping idols
5,i love this game so much it is really fun and interesting the characters have wonderful design
5,good game great graphics reminds me of zelda but the new update messed up the game everytime i try to log in it kicks me out the game
5,add skip bottom story so long for hours i just wanna explore scenery not being stuck for hours doing a hour quest for just half a wish
5,it is a great app i love it but i am having a hard time opening the game i have storage but it will not open i am struggling
5,love the graphics open world many things to do many characters to choose from overtime as you collect them something i still enjoy playing lots
5,this is a great game with one of the best graphics and stories i have seen and one of my favorite parts of this game go for the characters their designs and different abilities i would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of anime manga and rpg games
5,hoyo give me my ten wishes back it ate my ten pulls while i am lagging did not got anything back i would really appreciate it if you fix this little bug that i found out from a player named yasha by the way here is five stars in my other account this games great when i am not lagging
5,it is amazing and it does have a weird fandom but i do not mind the problem is that i cannot always play because i keep logging off but i do not mind it since it does happen all the time overall the characters chef kiss and quality delicious i do hope that there will not be an ending to this game since it does have tons of theorys and lores which i love the most overall best game i have ever played play this game if you like guys and girls hehe
5,i love everything about this game but i hope genshin could make a voice chat option so we can communicate during cooperative mode other than that i give this game ten over ten
5,most likely the designs of each character and the map is what makes me rate this high
5,it helped me through a lot when i was younger and it still helps me now and even efficenter place it is still the thought that counts and it always make sure to go after the thing that you need the most liked how she needed her brother david remind you to always believe in yourself
5,it is a really fun game and the details and the design of the characters just wow and the quests
5,one of the best games developed ever a cross platform game that enables players to continue their adventure whenever and wherever they may be a cooperative available feature that makes genshin impact one of the few mmorpg that can be enjoyed together with friends and family superb back ground music out of this world graphics player abilities to jump run swim and now even dive underwater truly remarkable by mihoyo
5,excellent game and history and enjoy the peace you found in the game and music just perfect waiting for the anime
5,i love it it is so creative and fun and it makes you excited to wish for other characters
5,i started playing since twenty twenty two and got hooked because of the adventure and the main story of the game and when i saw that it got released on phones i downloaded it and the graphics are amazing for it being a phone version continue doing your amazing work hoyoverse and i hope this game continues to be the amazing game that it is
5,overall this game have a nice performance the quality the graphic are not bad as for the story and lore i would give it a ten over ten because they are very interesting and does have a good plot
5,really addictingly fun game no seriously literally be careful of the gacha plays great on mobile though bows are awkward
5,since twenty twenty one joined and still active till now not much fun if not huge spender but acceptable interesting storyline and anime
5,genshin impact is seriously amazing i cannot get enough of its stunning open world the awesome storyline and the wide range of characters the graphics are so detailed and exploring teyvat feels like an adventure in itself the combat system is super fun and there is always something new happening with the updates and events huge props to the developers for making a game that is not just addictive but keeps evolving it is my go to game and i cannot thank them enough
5,overall great game its open world character design is pretty neat graphics stunning
5,such a beautiful world building such a nice gameplay such an incredible story placed in a fantasy world love enjoying this game
5,i really enjoying this game even i do not mind the quality lag so well i see i like the characters and the religion map also i like the offcial art and is very fun to play it i do not have a single the most hate characters i really love all of them the song was to entertaining to listen to
5,this is one of some of the best games in mobile i been playing it for like a year it has good gameplay character design and nice open world but the only problem is the storage and the how hard is to get a character other than that this is one of the best
5,i think it is really fun i love all the new characters but two things it take so much storage but that is inevitable the second thing is i wish we get primo daily like maybe ten a day or something other than that it is amazing
5,my opinion it is really good judge by graphic gameplay and the character design with new outfit that really pretty it make the environment change last it is wish my luck to get keqing from standard banner t t
5,i love this game he is so incredible and amazing caracters are so beautiful and they are gameplay are so satisfying and cool
5,it is one of the best i have played aside from the storage problem this is the best if you like enjoying the graphic
5,this is one of the best games ever the only problem is that it is a gacha game so people like to hate on it because it also has a bit trash community which makes people think differently about the game for me it is a mno rpg open world combat game with gacha elements that has a very interesting story lore etc i really recommend this game if you like mno rpg open world games and if you have have alot of free time storage and mental health to sacrifice
5,either planned or damage control i got the rewards with more to come what more could i ask for really
5,astonishing graphics beautiful regions for lots of exploration lore story quests and truly amazing battle it has it all the best game i have ever played it is more than worth it to download it
5,i have played this game since the release and i used to enjoy it but after playing it for a while i cannot deny that the story writing and it is execution is getting downhill the lore is deep and intricate but the way the main story is presented is laughable most of the characters who have potential wasted just like that honestly i do not even understand why the quest must be fast paced like that it was just very underwhelming
5,i have found no major issues with this game as time passes it just keeps on getting better it does take up a lot of storage but that is understandable considering the graphics quality i have been playing this game for years now and have no plans on stopping
5,still the best game still having problems with space probably this will be my last update on the game due to lack of space to update i will be pleased if tou found a way for example being able to space it on an sd card or on cloud to dramatically reduce the space of the game thank you for this lovely trip on a beautiful magical world hoyo
5,thanks for taking away my boredom people who are thinking of downloading twenty gigabyte game on your phone one advice just download it you will not regret explore the magical world the characters the lore the world exploration the graphics the music etc all make this game a top notch hats off to the developers for developing such a game
5,lots of fun and i love the story and art design the only thing that gets a bit annoying is the lag on mobile and the amount of storage it takes up but other than that it is an amazing game
5,unfortunately i have no words for this yes i am extremely glad that something new has appeared in the game but it takes up one hundred percent of my phone our paths diverge on this road i delete the game from my phone but i promise we will meet someday i had a great time playing this game many emotions many words but my travel ends here we will meet again and i will come with new emotions thank you it was a wonderful travel see you soon maybe
5,love the game but the storage is a issue four is my last update my android is almost defeated i have played since but the storage is insane for phones please do something about this
5,my experience has been great so far just started playing a week ago and i am already addicted i would suggest especially because it is an easy game to play
5,i used to hate genshin back then in twenty twenty but then i interested and liked it because my friend played it the game is well done and the graphics is quite good but compared to my honkai star rail and genshin my honkai star rail is more lagger than my genshin awesome game keep it up to update game like this hoyoverse
5,this game has some lags but every thing else is perfect the characters are stunning and they have backstorys forcing me to the end of my seat this game is amazing with lots of adventures to do
5,fontaine is very enjoyable and looking to the four update so far i really love the game and the gacha i should accept that i am not lucky as always ninety fps and one hundred twenty fps for smoother gameplay and for the resin at least make a feature that you can still gain resin even if the daily resin cap is full that is all and keep up i love the game so yea
5,played and it was great however i would love the pity system to be lowered to at least seventy five pity per five star and also we only get resin per eight minutes i wish we could at least get resin instead of one and the resin cap is sixty but i think it should be at least twohundred because one daily boss takes up forty resin and you only get boss drops per boss i am adventure rank fifty six
5,started to play the game for quite some time and started loving it from the character design to story lore and events the game has a lot to offer its jam packed on what you look for an open world game
5,the world is amazing the story and the characters if you want to play this on mobile make sure your phone has enough storage i play on pc but placing on phone is also nice since i can play anywhere i like
5,best game ever mihoyo games are always fun some of the players always find something to be annoyed about but i seriously do not care about those kinds of players i just want to enjoy the game beautiful breathtaking visuals and just a perfect game for people like me thank you for everything mihoyo
5,i love this game such breathtaking views sometimes they even make me stay afk enjoying the beautiful scenery and music anyway the character designs are perfect oh and the new update is quite good
5,i absolutely love this shit dawg i hope that it will not take me for a while to get like a million primo playing this game gave me a chance to take a break from my stress from classes and exams and from other pvp platforms and a chance to explore something glorious i hope this game will not turn me into a fatass discord mod wait i forgot something i do not have a discord anyways please give me five stars or four stars characters or weapons thank you by the way
5,you guys have no idea how much i love this game so much whenever i see merch or cosplayer i would scream the top of my lungs the style characters stories graphic adventures they are all awesome please keep updating so players would not get bored although we might get problem if we used android i do not really care as long as it is genshin impact or hoyovers game i would likely recommend please do not ruin my expectations and never change my mind have a nice day suki
5,has a very good themed graphics a long story and more to explore even it has multiplayer after adventure rank eight i feel it worth for the space it occupies
5,this game is really fun to adventure the graphics is really good no bugs the character is amazing just need another sound effect from the characters
5,cannot get enough of this game just wish we could dress our characters more especially the traveler and pet play hold the dogs and cats but other than that i love playing and swimming lol
5,i really like the game its pretty has very nice aesthetics and amazing open world cool characters and amazing storyline i would always play this game with my friends and explore the world with them
5,really good over a experience and story lines my personal favourite part is characters and team building so many combinations and synergies would like to see more frequent events and other sources for primo and resin
5,had playing this game for years and nine months straight and everyday why because i love this game so much this game have beautiful graphic and wonderful ost first gacha games i ever played and i very satisfied with all the characters i hope i can get all characters in fontaine
5,spectacular graphics for an open world mobile game the game mechanics are kept simple and the voice acting is on point a very fun journey indeed recommend one hundred percentage
5,the game is pretty good i started playing since four until now it is been years i am playing this game and so far the story is interesting the graphics is amazing too they got a lot of cool details and i love it
5,four star because i love it and i really enjoy the story quest and the thrill when you wish for a character but get disappoint real quick and of course the character they are so hottie but seriously star because the glitch it is really hard to play genshin on your phone like dvalin who i only see different kind of shape and color and i do not really care about the storage because internet connection is my problem i accidentally delete this and i am here suffering downloading the resource we do not have wifi
5,i love the art style and story if this game it looks so good and the story of this is just great especially when you get characters first the beginning of the story this whole game is just great in many different ways
5,best game ever character and story is compelling and the art is stunning the gacha and the whole primo farming thing is a bit grindy but i guess that is the point very fun otherwise met lots of fantastic people thanks to this game god bless
5,its a very nice game an open world where you can travel different places what i would like to ask if its possible incorporate a open microphone during cooperative with your friends that would be really fun
5,very nice game i have been playing this for a year and i would say this is my top favorite game in my game list i love all part of this game the combat adventure solving mechanisms and the last is the graphics i just have one request make other ways to game resin because most playerd like me who played this game for a year just want a resin to spend in a game or add more events on the way that is all overall ilove this game
5,very fun tragic sad and hard but an amazing game probably the best open world game you can do multiple mission quest cook build your character give your characters weapons and artifacts fight travel and discover new things
5,this game is super fan and there will all ways have event but the promogems they give is super cheap but sometimes have best reward geshin impact make me learn about english and the story gives you more knowledge like never give up or fighting is the best option if you need to i all ways remember my first play this game that i really super because this is the first time i play rpg in my phone so this game make me happy and you can find new friends
5,best game it have everything like adventure vast open world to explore variety of characters many biomes good story line graphics many playable characters in t can make you to feel your own anime story that every anime watchers always wanted
5,overall i have had a really fun time playing the combat is easy to understand and quick to learn the characters are amazing and all feel different and it is still a challenging game
5,i absolutely adore genshin impact the graphics‚ characters and story line are amazing the only downfall is how much space it takes up
5,super good game and updates not to mention like ninety nine of the players are super friendly and will help you with everything you need at a low adventure rank i have spent so much time in fontaine the region is just amazing so many underwater puzzles and things to do
5,love this game i have been playing almost since the first release and i have enjoyed playing it graphics are great soundtracks ate awesome and the storyline is highly enjoyable
5,genshin impact is such an amazing game the storyline the details the characters etc everything is so unique i have been playing ever since the game came out and i am so thankful that mihoyo made this game i would recommend playing this game a lot to keep up with the events and stuff like that
5,i always thought why people were talking about it so much but now i understand although it needs five gigabyte space in total it is worth it i have been playing it for nearly hours straight it is so fun and immersive i greatly recommend if it is possible for you to download it
5,thumbs up for creating this game with wonderful graphics and entertaining battle gameplay and open world exploration if i may suggest for your future upgrades please add a mount to ride on for easier exploration of the vast teyvat and also an auto loot of monster drops should really enhance the experience of genshin gamers good job mihoyo more power
5,it is been a year since i play this game i even brought a new phone so i can play more smoothly everyone is hating on you now but i prefer to look on the brighter side thank you for this wonderful year and thank you for giving me an unforgettable memory i still love this game and i am still supporting your games since twenty seventeen let the world know how talented you all in making games i am here to support you guys about the anniversary rewards i have no comments but it can be improve
5,still the best game i have played so far so much adventures and playing it makes me really forget about the time there is some features i wish the developers would consider making though i wish there were some monsters which can be tamed and be pets and will accompany and help the character through fights also monsters which can be mounted would be nice given that sometimes the map is too big to be explored by foot that is it i hopenthe developers would consider this thank you
5,everything is perfect like for real i loved fontaine so much that i one hundred percent area in my alt already my main account is focused on the story not exploring the music and everything is clearly making me addicted to genshin once again keep expanding fontaine and i might get a new phone lol gigabyte surviver here still have about ten gigabyte left thank you hyv you have done a great job making me addicted to all your game
5,one of the best available mobile games massive open world area that gets expanded constantly a good story and amazing music updates are constant coming in around every one point five months as well the gacha system is also fair and you can one hundred percent free to play the entire game without having any problems
5,it is an amazing game i have been playing since like april ninth and i have stuck with it beautiful storyline awe inspiring graphics it is simply too good definitely recommend only minor is that you need a lot of space but it is worth it
5,i have been playing since almost the start of this year and i am already in love with it the character design the events the quests the downside is that it takes a lot of storage
5,best open world rpg game for mobile yet the combat is simple and fun the exploration and world is top tier the music also banger no end game yet i do not care about the end game actually the story is great in the beginning but its getting better and better trust me warning some of the fans kinda weird they try to ship char in the game i mean in the most weirdest way just ignore them
5,overall review the best free to play game period awesome story great combat mechanics exploration puzles and last but not least husbandos and waifus sim ps lookout for the massive file size review fontaine is great but it is a real shame we cannot swim underwater in other regions
5,this game is really fun actually i just started playing but i could tell that the details and the storyline in the game is really awesome one problem though it sometimes kicks me out of the game for no reason i hope you can fix this
5,i will admit i was a little reluctant to give this game a try thinking that it was all show and not tell but i am actually having a blast playing this game i only downloaded it yesterday and it already got me hooked if only they made a version to play on nintendo switch i would be set for life
5,it is great game my favourite game after the walking dead game series but can you add game controller support on android i play on my pc but also play on my android and i really like if add controller support xbox controller
5,this game is so good and even me and my brother nor cousin loves to play and used to top up more because of this game the anniversary is near i hope you guys give us more reward and more events or likes five star standard characters i am kidding it depends on you guys this game teach me how to earn how to save and also love your family this game taught me how to cooperate and how to be sociable i just want to thank this game my life has changes alot because of you guys ily all
5,this is a really nice game the graphics are amazing and the storyline is just great the character designs look incredible and i can tell they must of taken so pomg to create i love this game and so many people around me talk about it non stop so i decided to try it out and here we are playing all the time i just want to say well done to the creators you did an amazing job and you succeeded to impress me well done ten over ten
5,amazing cool story amazing graphics problem it is so boring when you have to stop half way through a story to level up your character to continue
5,it is a really good game i love it but the thing is the space it takes i see it at the top of my list of things that take up space for my phone i think it is above a four but less than five i really like it though ️ edit since released i experience a crash in the game when i am underwater i cannot play because of it i hope this get fixed
5,best game everything will go smoothly if your device can withstand the insane storage consumption and the graphics my advice to mobile players is to lower your graphics to the lowest that way you can enjoy smooth gameplay smoothness over graphics if you would ask me if you have a potato phone then condolences to be honest
5,this is the highest quality mobile game i have ever played do not be fooled be people who say it is pay to win you can beat the game while unlocking a ton of great characters without paying dollar
5,you will probably never see a better free open world the gameplay is really relaxing a lot of content story can be quite interesting and heartwarming the problem is with the rng grinding the same domain for couple of months for good character builds can be quite annoying you also have no guarante you will be able to get something good also the creators hardly ever listen to the community we keep asking for increase in resin cap for like years even forty resin more would be great but they say no
5,hoyoverse i love this game so much for my whole life cause this game has chill vibes interact with attractive characters slaying enemies grind for artifact and many more it makes my day a lot and i have been enjoying it a lot when i played it keep up the marvelous work hope to see more excitement in throughout the whole updates and in the future as well
5,it is really a wonderful game but this past days i have been experiencing some error the loading screen take too much time and i cannot even play it no it is not my cp cause i have fifty six gigabyteand eight gigabyte ram it is just will not let me in the game i refreshed it but nothing i hope you will fix this it is really a good game and it will be a shame if i will delete it
5,excellent all around graphics are smooth the world is massive the characters are numerous each have different abilities and i like that lots of content to explore and complete
5,this game has very good graphics although the storage is a wee bit high but i get it also i have cannot finish the fishing quest cause i somehow cannot catch the fish the bar will not show up
5,in depth lore six gig of mobile gaming data fast paced combat large world enjoyment to grinding so much free content not pay to play buying in game for things you want to buy not have to large community base only faults are in game messaging early on but you have to play and level to unlock feature overall a fantastic game i have only scratched the surface and been playing weeks cannot wait to join rest of community cooperative mode when leveled character update review soon
5,i love this game and the events are so cool and the story quest for the five star characters is good but the only problem is the lag and the sheer cold in dragonspine it would be more helpful if you make the cryo characters immune to the sheer cold so it can help with the exploration but i still love the game
5,been in the fandom for over a year but was not able to play until recently but i have to say this game was a major change in my life best ztory characters lore all this is absolutly amaznig things that make this game the best i have seen in my life although the storage is a major problem but the game is absolutly marvelous
5,the best open world game i have ever played amazing story very very good graphics good gameplay but network is the only problem you should download this game if you want to play the best open world game in the world
5,it is definitely a good game to play it has a lot of intriguing storylines the only downfall is that you have to play when internet connection is available well at least for me i have tried several times just with my network but i get booted out of the game
5,so i play this game since i think the release of inazuma so like version two point zero and and i have become a huge fan of this game what inspired me to play this game were the graphics and the fact that it was a huge open world plus it was covid time and i had nothing else to do now i cannot say that sometime it gets a little boring especially in the last few patches before the release of the new region when it is like this i take a break i did like this before the release of fontaine and now i am back
5,i play this game for about years now daily and i gotta admit this is the first game that makes me obsessed you gotta admit that the storyline and the music in this game is top tier but still artifact grinding is killing those fun time but i will still consider playing genshin from now on to the future
5,amazing experiences wonderful graphics amazing gameplay amazing stories amazing characters overall for me this is one of the best game i have ever played although the storage needed for this game is killing my phone its stil amazing as ever if your a big fan of open world rpg and adventure this game is one of the best really recommended ten over ten
5,this game was always good to me but now since i have lost my main account i am finally coming back to the game yet there is one issue since when did it turn into a such a huge gigabyte storage game last time i played it took like six gigabyte i think though it is understandable with all the new places and characters my device is gonna explode please send help
5,i love this game ever since i have downloaded it i uninstall other games that i do not olay as often as this game i hate myself sometimes when i finish all the quests and stories and now i have nothing to do but wait for the events and new regions as well as it is new quests and stories
5,the game is great audio background etc are all great but one thing i do not like is the wish system i do not have a five star character all i have got are four star character so it is suck to be a free to play unless you save a lot or primo one good thing about it is you do not need a five star character to beat and enjoy the game though i do need the mc though as she can upgrade her constellations with just leveling up rank or the story progress yeah it is hard to earn primo i guess i better sucked it up
5,an amazing game with months of content and an enticing storyline characters with deep backstories the only problem is there is not much in the way of appreciation for players and the events are repetitive and tedious
5,the game is really good its one of my main games so i suggest to play this game its kinda boaring because of the conversations but it stills good like perfect game for solving mystery exploring doing quests upgrading characters etc so its perfect which fits anything i am just asking the devs to add like skipping conversations and thank you for your time which you wasted for reading this d
5,one of the best anime game i have played on mobile the lore quests characters and weapons are just exquisite it is a well developed game with variety of locations with very adorable graphics excellent job done by mihoyo
5,my experience is magical with the graphics and the characters most times the characters talk for a long time but i am impatient over all it is a wonderful game to play
5,mondstadt feels a lot like home it is nice to revist some times just to see where my journey began i wonder if others do too liyue another grand adventure i met some of my favourite characters here that i adore still years on inazuma it is urple sumeru a great story with wonderful lore and fantastic characters you can also begin to really see how much their character models have improved over the years fontaine its cool almost makes me wish french people were real
5,best game ever i play it everyday and i totally recommend it but with the update i cannot open the party menu and the game crashes not sure if it is my pc but if possible in the four update can you add a feature to disable the party animations ty
5,i have been playing this game on pc for over a year and i just adore it the character designs are so imaginative and the actual world design is bright and beautiful the graphics are amazing and i love how immersive the plot is five stars i would recommend
5,i will be honest for the update now it is enough to add impressions like diving and others but it is a shame there are still bugs like exiting the map and others and there are several new missions that do not have voice over in my opinion this makes the mission boring
5,it is the best open world game i have ever played it is also very relaxed and a satisfying name so i highly recommend this game it is free and quality is just awesome and it runs very fast the story mode is very interesting i just kinda wish you could customize yourself like all games but it is what it is but overall it is a very good game
5,i am using oneplus nord ce lite five giga and it is smooth and great fps and although it take nearly twenty to thirty five gigabyte of space out my phone it is still normal and wonderful performance ram eight plus four gigabyte so i have nearly no lag but there is lag but only after two hours of constant gameplay wonderful and free to play game does not require money to be spent on the game relax and spent some time to go forward with the game by playing free to play characters
5,ngl i found this game off of a cute fan made picture of venti and started to get more interestd so i decided to download the game and it is so much fun there is a lot to do the only thing is it is hard to complete some of the stuff on mobile than it is on pc and stuff but other than that ten ove ten recommended
5,this game is honestly so fun but the down side is that i have the worst luck unfortunately either then that i think this game is absolutely amazing i never want the game to end but when you beat the game you can try out the other twin and see how their journey goes hope this short review helps five stars definitely worth it
5,impresive i thought that the underwater exploration would be very laggy but it is not it works really smoothly the lag that i am experiencing in previous update is lessen which is very nice the v is astonishing the underwater environment looks impressive and stunning keep up the good work for the next area update as the map become larger and larger i hope that the lag can be lessen tyu
5,really fun game amazing animation and drawn scenes that come rarely the voice actors are great and barely any ads this game is really fun i highly recommend it
5,absolutely the best free to play game available on android all other developers should take notes on how micro transactions are done by this game there are no ads no annoying pop ups constantly wanting you to buy anything and no pay to win mechanics a
5,genshin impact is such a great game it would great available at all platforms and with great graphics nevertheless the characters are all detailed and with great stories like my absolutely beautiful scaramouche kunikuzushi kabukimono wanderer the game story lore is well made and i can promise it will keep you hooked for days also genshin if you do not let me win my i will give a one star
5,i have been playing for a few days now and the game is just amazing the story quests and the adventures it is so challenging and that is what i like most the voice actors did a wonderful job too this is probably the best game i played
5,this is one of the best games ever i absolutely love the graphics the characters and everything else i do wish i could transfer data onto other servers but overall this is amazing
5,perfect in every way just make the app a little smaller for example delete the data from lets say every update is just more giga of storage consumed
5,the graphics and art style is absolutely amazing story is interesting and fun and character design is gorgeous overall i recommend genshin impact to everyone but i do recommend playing on pc or laptop rather than on phone
5,the gameplay is amazing however the size of the downloads is getting to be a massive drag on mobile space and ram the best option this game would need is to store the majority of the game on servers and have only the basic resources need to run the game on mobile
5,i just wanted to say that i really love playing this game and i enjoyed everything about it for the past two years this might be the last day i played this game because my phone cannot handle it anymore and i cannot also do the quest because it crashes and freezes i hope someday i can play this game again if ever i have a better devices and free time i wanted to say thank you genshin and hoyoverse for creating this wonderful game i will never forget the happy memories you gave to me thank you
5,honestly its the first game like it is kind that i ever played it takes a little grinding and hoarding skills lol but i trully appreciate it for what it is and the effort the developers put into it it seems like alot when your start late in the game it is okay go your own speed and enjoy the journey welcome to gi oh and yes the community overall cool can be a little weird at times
5,although it can cost a lot of your storage i think it is really worth it especially with the update with fontaine i think it is really worth it genshin is not fun at first but once you get to adventure rank twenty to thirty it gets really fun getting to inazuma and the chasm is really fun too good luck with your wishing
5,such a fun and detailed game been playing it for a while now the graphics are amazing same with the designs the only current issue i have is that it keeps crashing on my gaming laptop
5,if you are looking for a beautiful adventurous open world game then this game is for you the combat system is really nice but keep in mind the game is not too combat heavy edited my post to include how well done the regions of sumeru and fontaine are
5,best open world experience i have not found in any other game and characters are fantastic to play with hangout events and story quests also give many funny and delightful moments throughout the game though i do not have any five star character so far
5,this is by far one of the best games i have ever played in my life its so realistic the quest are sometimes challenging which makes it even more fun to play it is so cooll
5,i really enjoy the new gameplay detective and attorney but there are some new bug when i use wanderer skill on the elevator and press it again to unfloat the floor of the elevator vanish and wanderer falling down indefinitely
5,definitely takes elements from other games but overall definitely fun to play regardless certainly not as high quality as games such as detroit become human god of war ragnarok or stray but i can say for certain this game is so very enjoyable nonetheless and it is free to play unlike the three i just listed if you are broke but want something of good quality with enjoyable gameplay i would highly recommend this game
5,okay i as disappointed as i am about the anniversary i still have to give this game credit it is really cool and i enjoy playing it definitely room for improvements but overall a really amazing free to play friendly game
5,best game i have played in the last years i have been here since day one and never regretted it genshin managr to make character relatable and feel human while everyone is very kind in their own way even if the world looks grim
5,my favorite game of all time has amazing lore and characters and graphics and you can see that the people working on this game put a lot of effort into this game and the world this story takes place in is not just split two sides like here are the good guys here are the bad guys instead there are many sides and its a bit hard to tell wich side is on the wrong and wich side is lying about being on the right the gameplay and game is amazing and is definitely my favourite game of all time
5,it is a really fun game and i enjoy it immensely character and world design is beautiful and there is so much to discover the game is a bit large in storage space but with the right device it is super fun and easy to play
5,genshin is amazing no question any game so popular will attract some hate but anyone can see within the first five minute playing the game it is really damn good my only complaint is the inability to skip cut scenes
5,this is a very interesting and long term story game with awesome characters storyline main story and terrain even though getting characters might be hard it is still perfectly enjoyable and comfortable with just our main character i definitely recommend
5,casual relaxing eh hem abyss game that is phenomenal on pc but convenient on mobile game music is amazing character designs diverse with breathtaking scenery there is no endgame content so take your time enjoying the game
5,for years of years i searched this type of game like great graphics great storyline just enjoy and feel its adventure explore the world to get everything you need and for heros practice makes everything perfect like use the bow one for distance kill and you do not have to pay any kind of money but you can if you have primo deficiency or just want the best characters for you there are no flaws in this game generally thank you hoyoverse to create this masterpiece
5,been madly in love with gi ever since i started playing it though sometimes it feels like a chore but the experience of an open world and boss fights are amazing caution you would get addicted to gambling it is a gacha game
5,the game is very fun and intersting even though i play in a mobile device it is not that laggy and the story and character are aten over teni hope the game can be as interesting as it right now in the future
5,love the game so so so much i have one thing i would like added and that is a feature where you can trade characters for other characters i would trade my constellationkeqing for anything rn the service is also amazing i lost my account back in september and they kept replying to my emails quickly i got my account back within at most months
5,good great and i very enjoyed playing this game but i am so unlucky i only have five stars characters sbut it is alright as long as this game continue being such a good game i recommend this game to everyone it has lots of positive things like good graphics good story line great animation and lots of fun and compliment tasks to do thanks for making this game and i hope to continue developing this game my thanks
5,i like the graphics and everything on mobile but the problem is that mobile players cannot see the damage atack text on the screen ice for element burst for cryo characters and grass and it is bothering me as well if you could squeeze in those stuff in the next update mobile players and me would appreciate it
5,this is the most fun role play game i have ever played it has a lot of lovely and cute characters and it also has an interesting storyline which made me play this game i wonder when will lumine and aether will be reunited again i am waiting for it as for the closing i really enjoy this game and i suppose i love this game because my characters stayed with me more than the actual people that i have
5,super nice game i have had some problems like lagging so much that it kicks me out but overall the game is awesome there are plenty of characters to choose from areas events extra recommend for those who like offline but you can play online as well when you want to help with worlds quests but not everything
5,there are no other words for genshin impact it is by far the best game i have ever played it offers real experience and the locations are similar to the real world plus the story lines are so convincing it makes you think it is real five star finally fontaine is here yay
5,the game is great even though its laggy its our internet connection i love the character designs and the new places to explore in the world of teyvat so i give it aten over ten
5,it is good for most of the game play but there has been bugs and glitches when doing certain storys overall everything else is not so bad
5,i love this game for pretty much everything is has to offer except the grass i can not use and fire pyro moves on grass or the character i use diluc currently will take more damage from burning themselves on the grass than from what i am actually fighting which is ridiculous to me would rate five stars if i were not taking one hundred damage per second and losing one thousand to two thousand hp per what are supposed to be simple overworld fights i know this has already been nerfed once but still wl five
5,one bothers me is that players need to wait until it is fully sixty resin i have patience but i would like to suggest to reduce the time and making the resin fill up a little faster this advantage will help building their characters even more fast and good other else is very amusing and i enjoy this game a lot
5,everything is good characters world the areas the quests and the best thing is that it is an open world and you can go anywhere if i could i would rate the game six stars
5,a love this game though are i p to me for also playing on mobile i still really love the game i wanna star saving up to get venti fontaine looks beautiful the characters have very cool and beautiful designs to the underwater thing for fontaine sounded sick even my dad loved it because of how cool it looks
5,best game out there the plot is amazing the adventures characters surprisingly polite players easy gameplay i got used to it lovely experince the best soundtracks inazuma and dragon spine and sexy voices
5,great game i have not gotten to far into it but i hope the gig download and now another ten giga is worth the drain on my memory awesome game and graphics just wish i had found it sooner also if this newest update does not do it please fix the crash problem
5,this game may have sucked away my soul and killed my dog but it is absolutely massive for a one hundred percent free game with five or six over seven if you are a time traveler fully explorable nations unique elemental interactions an actually good gacha system and still runs amazingly on mobile
5,as a new player it is really good overall good graphics storyline and at least for me has a good balance if you prefer the adventures or the story this game will be best if people play at a high storage phone or pc
5,considering the game is free the devs have put so much work in it there are some flaws like no end game content bad rng for the gacha artifacts and rare update on quality of life in game overall its a great game the amount of space its required is getting bigger and bigger as expected but this is getting ridiculously huge for mobile devices
5,i was actually not going to play this game when my friend introduced it to me but after watching the ads i was too annoyed with it so i downloaded it and give it a try now i am addicted to it especially some characters their design is too beautiful and i enjoy reading the lore too i play this game for almost two years and i am still in love with it
5,absolutely amazing the best game i have ever played beautiful storyline character designs massive open world and beautiful graphics i one hundred recommend especially with the upcoming region fontaine although takes so much storage currently storage for mobile is thirty six gigabyte and pc is sixty gigabyte
5,come to think of it overall genshin is a very great game but the downside is the in game rewards they give they do not give enough for players to freely clear certain in game content i would wish there was a grind able content for us to get to give way to free to play players
5,from scenery to music to characters to story to diversity in music and regions to overall visuals everything thing is top notch edit please work on the lag a little even if i use both internet connection and mobile data it is still lagging
5,perfect game for those who wants to explore and story is decent for most the people but overall i can say story is well maintained background song fights boses and archons gods are just so amazing that is why it is been over a year and i am still playing it
5,edit five issue below resolved hope this upcoming update it will not happen again edit seven i am now encountering server network issues i do not have a lot of devices connected to my internet connection and i have never encountered this error until the last update maintenance cannot log in now and play and claim my everyday primo from welkin
5,this game is amazing it is been an year since i started playing this and it is by far my favourite game the updates characters regions story graphics and everything i love it so much
5,for new players reading these reviews trying to understand if genshin is worth it all of those memes a few years ago about it being cringy and stupid are total lies the game is not cringy at all and the characters and story and gameplay and community are awesome the android version unfortunately does not run super well so i would recommend getting a backup device if you are ever in a pinch and say run out of storage but overall a spectacular game
5,besides the gacha system everything else is top notch and the developers take the community seriously and many players are friendly and will accompany you on your early days and who could resist free in game rewards right which is so so frequent and apart from that the character designs and sceneries and enemies are such a masterpiece and the graphic quality is as good now i am currently on my adventure rank fifty six i have been playing for a long time though it takes space but hey it is worth it
5,ten over ten the only thing that bugs me is when you go into the event or survey it this makes you log out of game and then it has to reconnect to server but even from that it is still a great game graphics are amazing and i love deliuc
5,actually at first i am so confused at this game but after that it is starting to get beautiful story character flashback quest primo character and even exploration killing some monster boss and etc even the places i am into this
5,this game is really fun and a neat adventure game it has a good story and awesome characters with very fun ways in combat they all have very different ways to fight personalitys and apearences if you enjoy lore story and adventure i would recommend
5,the game is a goat for anime watchers it is a treat for me the best open world story for both pc and phones as a player whos been playing it since the only thing i want at this point story and archon quest rerun to freshen up our memories and older player will even invest more time in the game hoyo do not even have to give rewards just story reruns
5,one of the best game in play store story line and graphics is excellent but the game download size is around six gigabyte not recommended for low end devices
5,the game is aweasome playable for free no ads can pay to win more and better characters totally optional the game is gigabyte absolutely worth any money you want to put in
5,i love this game so much like it was my favourite game and to be honest i do not find any problems in this game it is like the perfect game no ads amaizing graphics outstanding stories and so much more i love this game keep going with the amaizing effort
5,i have not played in a while my phone could not afford genshin anymore but i sure do enjoyed playing it it is an open world gameplay that let us explore teyvat as much as traveler can access not only that i could wish for characters i liked with variety of characters with different designs and combat style i sure did enjoy using them the game have fantastic graphics and designs i also had a fun time playing with my friends on cooperative i hope to be able to play this game once again
5,i love everything about this music graphics characters everything it is beautiful and the experience is great to explain in single line this is a better than expected game
5,whats up with the review deletion anyway love that there were a few qol changes and that xinyan was fixed seems like the backlash has finally made the game better would love some improvement for cooperative i do not like manually leaving the cooperative mode each time my friend leaves my world
5,genshin lmpact is an amazing game and have amazing story quests and side quests with nice character the only thing is just that there is a lot of loading to start the game sorry for any new players that have to go through that but that is normal
5,amazing game awesome graphics and fabulous soundtracks the character designs are super likeable and lovely as well the only issue i face is regarding ping which is generally two hundred for me i play asia i wish hoyoverse resolves this
5,overall the games good and the characters are pretty fun to play too there are also event though i would like to say that maybe it is me that is too fast but everytime after i finish an event it feels like there is nothing left to do except doing commissions and domains everyday edit albedo tcg in please edit thank you for hearing me out i love you hyv
5,always wanted to play this game since it came out but since i have a cheap phone and cannot afford one that i can play this game on i just only watched streamers and youtubers play the game but now that i bought a new phone that can handle this game with my saved money i finally for the love of god play this game and wow the game itself is wonderful wished i could have played it sooner but yeah my family is poorten over tenpeak of open world games
5,im inlove with this game this is so perfect best rpg games yet i have ever play even though after a few updates seems like me or other free to play player have a low rate of pulling five star characters i want to give a four six stars rate but here is a five stars rate good job team developers keep it up for next update
5,i have given them five star since twenty twenty one and i never thought of changing the customer service is very very good they always reply on my questions within a day and clear the misunderstanding right away heads up to those people who works on their customer service thank you so much
5,my pare nots hate me for playing this but i still do its a really good game with great character design and good music you also never get bored because it is constantly gives you things to do i really like it overall it has great open world experience
5,absolutely love this game the scenes and graphics are great the open world map is beautiful but i play on my phone so i have to delete a lot of stuff to get the updates still love the game though
5,the game is amazing and the story too but i have this problem on my phone in ventis story quest act confront stormterror when fighting dvalin it is laggy on mobile i hope the devs fix this please i wanna play the game without the lag edit they have updated it and the lag was gone by the way it is an amazing game thanks developers for fixing it
5,this game has been my addiction over the past few months it is amazing the graphics the lore chefs kiss i have had loads of fun and it became a virtual hang out for me and my friends one things missing though android controller support please pls i beg you please give us android users controller support as fun as this game is some of us struggle with touch control so please have mercy please pls please pls please
5,it is one of the best gacha games you can come across there is always something to do in new updates and the character design is so amazing the only problem i have is the resin cap but besides that this game is absolutely amazing
5,i am never the type to play open world games in gacha types of games but this got me hooked compelling story flashy effects immaculate music and the characters that feels so alive but out of all of them i say it is the graphics that is the most beautiful over all great game
5,i love mihoyo games they always put a lot of effort and dedication genshin impact is one of their great ones of all time from the music art characters plot story quests almost everything from the game is great my only problem is that it is very heavy in mobile devices especially each update but it was understandable considering how much detail are put in the game i would still play it regardless because this is a great game one of the best open world rpg out there highly recommendable
5,this game is so addicting for me i was playing this game and i had a lot of fun this game has good quality the characters are really great they had the quality needed kaeyas voice is a bit like shawty nah hahaha just kidding the story is interesting for adventurers it explains all the game is equal and fair although i had no experiences playing with such a lagging game i do not know why but i am annoyed because i never played such an exquisite game i can say is that it has a very good quality
5,my brother and i have been playing this game since it came out and we love it there have been so many good characters and events throughout this game the storyline and character plots have not only been fun but exhilarating how it feels to play this game can not be put into words it is just a feeling that i get from playing the game there are challenging sections that make it an even more in depth experience playing genshin impact thank you for creating such an amazing gaming experience
5,i have been playing it for a year now and enjoyed every bit of it i play this star rail and honkai so this does not get all my attention all the time sadly and when all the desert updates came round it really got boring but now fontaine is in a few days it is dragging my attention back and i hope to enjoy it till the very end
5,the game has a lot of lagging on mobile devices sometimes it is bearable and otherwise it is not playable i hope that you make it possible to play it without much system requirements
5,really great game i think the graphics play style story is all very good even has an option for multiplayer so it is a really good game in general highly recommend for people who want a fun role playing game
5,it is amazing the only problem is that it takes a lot of space but i do not mind it at all the game itself has very good graphic and the characters designs are amazing
5,the graphics are really good controls respond well and the storyline and characters are my new obsession however when downloading it you must have a good amount of storage cause it is really big but all in all it is a good another suggestion is to add a beginners manual for new players i had to ask my friends how to achieve certain things edit if not for the sheer size it has it will not be so hard to download
5,out of the world exp made for us who long for vacation but stuck in our desk love the graphic and you can just see the dedication in every detail of the game superb
5,amazing game ever since i have heard about this game i was really interested in trying it for myself to see the hype i definitely do not regret it it is for me the best action role playing game i have ever played yes it requires lots of storage but it has a very beautiful and interesting storyline even the characters have stories of their own just the concept itself is worth all the hype i am obsessed with this game and would give it ten stars if possible
5,this game is fun but it has made me feel such pain i had to schedule an appointment with my counselor if you do not wish to spend money on a game or feel pain i do not recommend but other than the gambling addiction i have gotten from this and the mental strain it gave me after losing a to my least favorite character just to give me a fale hope on the permanent banner to yet again give me my second least favorite character than its a pretty good game i would say
5,i cannot describe how much i been loving this game it is great and exciting but the bad thing is that mobile users are now taking too much storage for us especially if you have a low end device and i hope i will be able touch grass again soon cause this game takes alot of time finishing the quest and story that is why people hating it the game and also the people playing judging it in my opinion
5,it is a very good game i have just started it and it is brilliant the graphics characters attacks weapons animals and the best part storyline brilliant and from starting i was big fan of mythical things and adventures things and i even like anime so if you like mythic and adventure this game is for you
5,it is a lot of fun i like that you get different characters with different attributes to use the dungeons have been fun and i am so glad there are waypoints i also like i can upgrade characters wherever i am at as long as i have the things required and love enhancing my weapons not gonna lie i am addict
5,amazing and very entertaining the best games for the year as always and i woyld love to request higher the chances for a good artifact to come and then lower the storage need since i only have a few storage left but thank you for creating this amazing game
5,one of the best open world mobile pc anime game character wep upgrade systems elemental system and battle system so great moreover great storyline i enjoyed playing the game
5,this game is awesome i remember playing sword of chaos at twelve years old when i first heard of this game i thought it would be just like that game but it is even more amplified with such beautiful and aweing landscapes each character is so unique you fall in love with them and go for them such an obsessive lore you want to dive into etc there is many things to love about this game i one hundred recommend thanks mihoyo
5,love this game there is so much to do and explore i just cannot get enough though the great game play and graphics do have a downside if i play too much or for too long my phone will heat up and i have to take a break and when i mean long i mean like twenty to thirty minutes but other than that it is a great game and i really enjoy it and recommend it to anyone who loves an action packed game
5,i really love this game its graphics are uncomperable and it is story plot is mesmerizing the thrill to enjoying the game and wondering it is true plot history thank you for creating this game until next time
5,this is the best open word game by a loong shot the devs here have done outstanding job at creating a world that is actually interesting and filled with rewarding quests and puzles apart from the main missions content which by the way is fire is added regularly so you are never really bored unless speedrunning exceptional storyline man this game is peak
5,this is one of the best games i have played so far and whats best is that it is all comes free like its fully upto you if you want to spend money or not and even if you do not it will not restrict your account level up or anything at all first of all it has already proved that it is one of the best games out there with sixty to seventy minute active players monthly when its zone for old gen games like league of legends minecraft and fps like pubg overwatch being new release compared to them
5,i have been playing for over a year now and i love this game so much highly recommend playing there are many quests events dailys exploring building characters and many more i am addicted hehe even though it needs a lot of storage
5,for me genshin impact is perfect good story concept excellent world events and graphic i also love the fact that you can thrive even being a free to play player so spending is your ultimate choice not an obligation i love this game so much well done
5,game is very good graphics are totally mind blowing environment is amazing controls are smooth you can play with multiple characters as you progress in the game
5,this is the best mobile game that i ever played but high specs phone needed to play this game smoothly overall this game is awesome and very different with other game no ranking system so you do not need to spend much money because you have no one to compete with just enjoy the game rpg players absolutely love this game because the stories are fascinating and the nature scenes are awesome with good bgm i have been playing for almost years and never get bored on this game
5,honestly while this game does have it is issues as does the company the actual playthrough and storyline is really good it is most everything you could want from an open world rpg i love the different characters and their personalities and stories not dori but i would like to see some better rep on skin tone but that is about it the plot is great and cooperative is very fun i have met alot of my best friends through genshin as sad as that is definatly a good play though nine over ten recomend
5,absolutely amazing no complain whatsoever hoyoverse i am begging you to give me more luck on my pulls or else i will squish you into a pancake using zhonglis meteor j this game does require a lot of storage the current version is not even the full thing there is more and i mean a lot more updates to come so before anyone downloads this game be sure that you have enough storage ehe
5,it is actually fun very beautiful great stories and most of all ofc is the characters they are perfect the design is perfect the voices are perfect and most of all the personality are perfect
5,based on my experience genshin overall is a pretty spectacular game it has an optimized user interface beginner friendly gameplay one of the most astonishing game graphics and last but not the least an intriguing story plot though it is a gacha game you cannot deny the fact that genshin is more than just your plain old gacha game where you just pull wish for characters weapons non stop
5,great game been playing for years since i said great game lol they send birthday cakes and fireworks in game lol play story mode and grind or upgrade beautiful game great mechanics and the details keep you looking and forgetting you are busy i found myself farming by accident in the beginning now i have to remember to farm lol
5,returning player highly excited to continue honing vr control experience via here this companys third person games i have played have influenced my dreams as magically as the disney esque glass and emerald floating castle i find myself phasing through as a ghost in them when i cannot play maybe because of these comments we could see bigger model playable characters gotta love the angelic avatar of different elements like earth and steel themes hows your overlaiden constellation collection
5,great game please add more nations i love it but please add an option to save all the data that you download into an file so that incase anyone deletes genshin impact accidently they would not need to go through the hell of hours of download
5,i played this on the playstation i enjoyed it but it got hard to get items for leveling characters so i lost interest but was feeling nostalgic so i downloaded it on my cell phone so far it is exactly how i remembered it and the graphics are awesome and it is fairly easy to play
5,great game still the best since two point four update but we do hope that by next major updates please add more places exiting mechanism similar to summertime fantasia and secret summer paradise and return those artistic character physics and character behavior that once present in cbt and once removed from patch one point zero to one point eight onwards
5,genshin impact is my favorite game but i am a mobile player so genshin updates are my biggest enemy it took eight hours to complete the genshin impact download but i really love this game i love nahida yanfei and other characters design genshin impact is a very good game but not very good for my storage good job hoyoverse
5,three point five k hours on mobile one k hours on pc and one hundred hours on playstation game is amazing have not been playing much of it recently though seen as i have been on honkai starrail since day but with the new area coming really soon i will be on more great sound track can be found on spotify too amazing visuals runs well on old ish devices example one plus five t from twenty seventeen it runs with very little issues on medium settings its also not too difficult i am arfifty wlsix with little struggle
5,it is a very good game with great quality and all the story quest and archon quest are also great the designs are very nice some characters are way too revealing but it is fine they look fine and all that is all keep it up hoyoverse
5,this game has had me hooked on it for so long the only reason why i been unable to download it is because of the gigantic download size but this was way worth the wait in my opinion i have to sadly give up on this game as it has made so even if i unistall i still cannot fix it so i have to unistall the game but in my mind it is still a ten over ten game
5,the best open world adventure game i have ever played the puzles and treasure hunting are really awesome i really enjoy playing with friends exploring different regions and fighting bosses
5,it is really amazing for a phone game free to play and no ads i wish i could rate it above five stars it is currently my favorite game it has a huge area to explore many awesome quests characters and things to do
5,this game have very interesting story and the character is just amazing each character had their own backstory and unique personality like a real person i very enjoying doing the archon quest and story quest but there only problem you need a lot of space for this game you need at least twenty gigabyte or more other than that this game is just super amazing i play it all night
5,love this game it will be my favorite game for a long time period but i have one little problem which is how much storage it takes up i still have not installed the eight update it is been nine days and i have only one option uninstall and then re install put it in my sd card and reinstall twenty plus gigabyte with my terrible internet amazing game though i love the charecter design the quests everythingten over tenthis game is amazing like i said it takes up a lot of storage
5,i really enjoy the gameplay the storyline is amazing everything about genshin impact is amazing i like how big the map is for a open world type of game the graphics are spot on and for it all being a mobile game is pretty astounding keep making games like this
5,what else do i have to say this is an absolute masterpiece the osts are very relaxing or very intense the characters are easy to attach to the gameplay is insane and the lag is nonexistent which is incredible for a five gigabyte game
5,ive been playing this for like a year now and this is actually the best game i have ever play the updates and event are so cool this was the first game i actually have experienced comfort every time i feel down this game is actually the one making me feel happy not only is this game fun but it is also comforting never would have thought i would be so obsessed with a game keep up the good work i am hoping for more improvement in the future
5,i love genshin been playing it for a year now i must say its an expensive game you need a good device to play the game since its very heavy on graphics but all in all the theme song and the lore is very amazing its just hard to earn primo when you are lazy and an free to play haha
5,this is the best anime fighting game i have ever played i love all the detail and all the characters things i wish that would be added are more dark skin characters to be more inclusive and mounts because of the time limit for sprinting
5,update it is been almost years since i played genshin impact i have a lots of fun here has several features that make it stand out from other games in the genre it has an expansive open world with a variety of environments to explore it also has an interesting story and characters that players can interact with additionally it has a unique combat system that combines action based combat with elemental abilities thank you so much
5,what to say about it it was like my dream come true i saw many people playing this game and i really wanted to play but could not because of my phone but now i can but it is still unsure to me the game is like love at first sight a wonderful and top notch game just the way i wanted it to be and yes addictive but i love it thanks to the team for making this wonderful game and making my wish come true
5,incredible i cannot believe i can play this game on my phone do not get me wrong the initial update after download took literal hours but once that was done it is been nothing but smooth sailing after that
5,i have been playing for a year and all i could say is bravo again hoyoverse you have outdone yourself again the game so far is amazing no bad thoughts so far the lore background music characters all amazing and detailed
5,immersive after sevenmo i still love it wish the rng was a little more favorable but who does not update new check out a genshin getting started guide so you do not fall victim to early account mistakes a good beginner guide should cover all the basics and prepare you for upcoming endeavors
5,the characters are just spot on the eyes look very realistic in my opinion but there is no little boy characters you can play as which is kinda untouched but the rest of the game is just amazing i love the strory so much as well
5,this game is an open world game wich is one of the types of games i love another thing is that the graphics and design and concept of this game is just awsome animations are also awsome the game is very fun to play as it also haves side missions wich makes the game give more activities the game has a really awsome combat system and details of the combat system overall i recomend playing this when you need an open world game
5,genshin impact is one of the best games i have ever played it opens with action and holds your attention allowing you to spend hours simply exploring the map with fascinating new characters and fun events genshin is a must have for any mobile gamer this game i had an intriguing story leaving you hooked within an hour however there is no oceania server for us aussies and kiwis and it takes up so much space on your device mine currently has nine gigabytes occupied by genshin install this
5,i love this game so much amazing storyline character design backstories for each character and nation i love how the combat system is set up and how you do not need to pay money to get character or weapons you want fontaine is near ladies and gentlemen prepare yourselves
5,this game is awesome it also is so much fun with the puzels fights etc my personal fav is lisa and also amber they are my favs personal favs there is so much to explore in this game and there is amazing grapics i am so happy i found an awesome game like this one and not one of the boring ones i love this game so so much its the best game i have ever got
5,one of the best games on playstore i am not only a mobile player but also a pc player so i know just how great this game is it is world building npc open world and all the other things are just top of the line and believe me you will not be finding this kind of mobile game with such high quality production in any other game on playstore the only con is that despite being a well rounded game it has some serious issue in optimization on mobile i mean my eighty eighteight is not able to keep up
5,i lovee this game so much and its great overall though the disadvantages i barely got sleep and i did not go outside for almost months yeah its crazy but true actually i got all the characters last banner and i am grinding again but i now fixed my sleep sched and limited the hours i play so you all be careful and take care it is very addicting
5,ok so not only it has amazing graphics but amazing fighting scenes and you can play with your friends but there is a problem it is not a bug and it is not there fault but it takes up so much storage that on my ipad i cannot get it i have to use my phone you might think why not just delete stuff well i do one time i delete all my apps and i still could not get it i delete all my files pictures and videos but still nothing sadly but i can still play it so whatever but amazing
5,hi hoyo gotta love this game when it first came out i totally misjudged it and thought it was a stupid game i mean i wasted a whole year hating on it until the tiktok algorithm decided to recommend some genshin videos to me i finally gave in and after playing it for quite the while all i have to say to the newcomers is that save your sanity because after getting gambling addictions you will not have any of it left
5,awesome game just make sure you have the space for it a very huge game elemental powers different veritys of combat missions and all in a open world map absolutely love this game
5,i love the game but i wish there would be a function where you can replay old events that players missed and can experience the event to also pick up on missing parts on the game lore like in honkai starail so everyone can experience it both old and new players
5,so i just began the game i have only got amber so far and i think it is a really cool game because it is open world and you unlock stuff as you go so i definitely do rate this a five star i recommend it it is worth your time trust me
5,by far my favourite game in the past i have always struggled to stay consistent with games but i have played genshin everyday since i downloaded it its endlessly entertaining quests about characters or history of certain places just deepen my interest with the game i can whole heartedly say that even when the storyline ends i am still gonna play awesome game
5,just a great game only if your prepared to empty your wallet every once in a while to get the character and or skin you want and as people say the game gets bigger and bigger and some people just do not have five five giga bites of space visuals are awesome but every couple hours you will crash at some point between adventure rank twenty to forty it gets very difficult to level up and the quests stack on but i have no problem with that
5,i love this game i have been playing it for almost years and i am not planning to stop now the storyline is nothing but exceptional from the start especially the inazuma and sumeru regions if you start playing this because of the good reviews i assure you that this will be one of the best games you have played
5,i really like this game but my only problem is that it takes up a loot of storage four gigabyte but other than that its a great game with great graphics coding lore and has a very large continuosly growing open world my only wish is that it had pvp and took up less storage
5,exploration is challenging and fun characters are well designed and have their own interesting stories and personalities the special effects are amazing overall a very fun game i have been playing for a year and i really like this game however one thing that bothers me is the storage requirements overall i like it
5,hoyo the gigabyte is too much my phone cannot go on much longer wth is this we are not even at fontaine yet edit thank you for reminding that i cleaned some caches a few minute ago and manage to finally download everything still love this game after all well done hoyo i love your game please keep it up
5,edit it is been almost a year now since i have started playing and the only problem i encountered is the size of the game which goes up by to four gigabyte almost evey month do not get me wrong the updates never disappoint they always bring exiting content and gamemodes which are very enjoyable but it is hard keeping up if you have a low end phone i suggest using mid range phones to avoid any inconvenience
5,very easy to use the sceneries are gorgeous and fabulous but sometimes the puzles are a little but complicated other than that it is a wonderful game
5,i love the storyline hoyoverse has given us through this game there is a lot of grinding to be done which is annoying as it relies on sheer luck but apart from that the immersive experience provided to the story is amazing
5,this game is amazing few years ago i would play this game nonstop until twenty twenty two i started to get bored of the updates and i became lazy to do the quests and only logged in for primo but ever since i saw the teaser for the new update it made me excited that i installed genshin again after not playing it for few years now i am currently waiting for my phone to finish updating the game and who knows i might get addicted again
5,i love this game so much the gameplay graphic character design all of that is perfect the best game ever i will not say the rng or gacha system is bad because it is like that we can play as free to play anyway so i will not bother
5,been playin this game since the beginning and this never fails to amuse me every update gives me a lot of fun gameplay and exciting rewards the characters unique perks and compositions makes it a lot more fun the gacha systems quite annoying the chances of you getting your desired character weapon is low if your free to play but that is expected in every gacha i will give a five star regardless so looking forward for more contents xiaoo
5,honestly this game is very fun to play in my opinion when i am bored i just play this game and i get so into it i sometimes rage quit you can play with friends and play in cooperative mode once you reach a certain level i love this game and the fandom the characters are all equally unique and the plot is super cool overall a amazing game and totally recommend if you like anime
5,the game deserves five hovoverse i did not think it is so good the controls are easy and as a phone player i thought it would crash your more high quality then a game i have and it lags more but i am a free play so no money from me sorry hovoverse ok defintally i suggest but you need to be patient because it takes lots of time to download though
5,it was so pretty amazing and very exciting perfect for gamers who wanna have adventures and go through different missions or quest it was so addicting game and pretty fun you can also join other servers if you want to have some accompany
5,i have been looking for an open world title like this since ages the overall experience is amazing the user interface does not seem clustered like some other games out there the app does not confuse you too much with the active quests you have the enemies are adaptive and you can easily counter them with proper strategy deserves a five star rating without a doubt
5,i loved playing it in the very beginning so much to do so many stories to be told so many photos to take but since i started around launch there is not much for me to do anymore the only things i look forward to are new areas events are recycled and repetitive new story comes once a year with the new areas and then you wait months for something anything new to come overall it is still an amazing game the devs put so much work into it and new players can look forward to binge playing it
5,play the game on my laptop and enjoy it there but this game takes up around a of my phone space and i cannot put it on my phones other larger memory card so unless you have a really large storage as part of the base phone it is not really playable on phone but again i really enjoy the game and hope it continues i want to see the end of the story hopefully some characters get buffed so all characters are fully viable throughout this game also please add backbone controller support
5,friendly to use even for newbies i started playing on my phone but later switched to laptop app we play as a family you can visit each others world and help each other out helpful during combat with large enemies i personally enjoy the wandering in open world concept not so much battling in domains often the cut scenes telling a story can be tedious since i do not care much for the lore but my experienced gamer kids do so it depends on your preference the visuals are gorgeous
5,genshin impact a really great open world game with many characters and story i really like it the characters are cool with their great skills and also the amazing story behind them the map is so big you will never get tired of exploring it adventuring finding treasures the graphics are great with many different terrain in different places i really love it please continue to make it more interesting for us travelers
5,one of my favourite games i can easily say that i will be sticking with it till the last update and beyond the controls and features are quick to learn making this a great game for new players the character design and open world are some of my favourite things it is difficult to run out of things to do in genshin it would be great if it could be made more friendly for mobile players as the size is quite large
5,this is the best game i have ever played i have been playing genshin for about years now and even though i am a pay to play it is still completely possible to play the game with all the functions as a free to play though it is going to be a struggle to get new character as a free to play so i recommend saving for a specific character instead of wishing every single time you can get a ten pull that is just my advice though it does take alot of storage though but it has good graphics five stars
5,i love the game its full of stuff to do especially if you just started there is cooperative mode so we can play with others and make new friends there is many rewards and many different events genshin impact has something that many games do not and it is open world exploration for quests you have to explore the world of teyvat and unlock teleport waypoints i really like everything in genshin impact from the characters to the music
5,the best game i have ever played its very soothing to play i have been playing for a long time since it was released and one thing i have to recommend to be added is to be able to change the position of the buttons mobile is indeed limited in controls as compared to pc but the fact they cannot be moved makes it a lot more limited so being able to move it around would be game changing
5,soo good interesting characters skills and strategies just enough instruction if you want it while giving the option to figure things out on your own which i love to do adventure rpg i have not enjoyed a game this much in a while plays great on mobile with two hundred gigabyte space onscreen touch controls are done extremely well i would like to see a larger limit on commission quests and a closer gap between level restricted quests and xp gain thank you for all your hard work devs
5,i truly love this game with the wishing system being really interesting and with the quests being really fun to do the best part of this game is with all sorts of puzles but can sometimes be frustrating with being able to climb glide and go all sorts of stuff with gajets and able to play with other players is really fun you do not have to play turn based but you do need to be able to know how to level up your characters and help them be stronger we all start somewhere in this game
5,the graphics are beautiful though you need a good device for it to be very clear or it is gonna be kinda blurry i like the music the places to explore and characters are definitely my favorite things about this game it is okay if you do not spend any money on it too it is just that you need to grind some more to get the characters you want comparing to the ones who do spend as someone who just deletes games quickly due to being picky i have been playing this for about a year now
5,fantastic if your device can run it then go for it great story fantastic visuals wonderful characters it is a great time my only gripe is that i wish they rerun past events be prepared for it to use a bunch of storage and drain your battery i personally use it as a quasi backup for the playstation five version play that first so you can save your progress elsewhere
5,honestly great been playing for several months now i am mostly housebound due to disability and this game makes a lot of days more bearable and fun i spend a fiver a month on the extra primo and that is about it but you do not have to spend money to be able to progress love exploring love the story love the vibe hidden treasures making food fishing and more main downside is the amount of space it takes up i had to get a memory card for everything else
5,probably the best game i have ever played amazing character design and story great graphics and very fun gameplay great for streaming calming down or just a rainy night you can play it with friends too people will put bad reviews and say it is not good or that it is too time consuming but really it is outstanding if you are always busy just do the quests in small parts however i do recommend getting it on a computer rather than a mobile device it sometimes lags and if harder to play on
5,i have a pretty new phone with one hundred gigabyte of storage but after a full days worth of downloading the frame rate is so bad it is actually just me looking at standstill images with my character moving a foot or two every so often edit after a few years i finally got it working on another device my pc and am having tons of fun it is a shame that i cannot get the wings of companionship anymore since my account was created more than a year before being able to play without crashing
5,incredible game with amazing graphism landscapes and musics though the plot is not the best it is always a pleasure to play it the characters are well designed and well written the only problem i found is the storage for phone users the game needs more than ten gigabytewhich is a lot i advice playing it on playstation or computer pc because of this otherwise i highly recommend this game
5,all in all one of the best games i have ever played best story graphics designs scenery character and many more my only problem is that in my device oppo aninefour there are no damage number and the freeze reaction at water body is not visible i do not know if it is on the device or in the game system but if it is in the game system i hope it will be fixed thank you ty
5,this is a great game and i have been playing for roughly two years the graphics the characters the story line and events are all exceptionally well done however the only problem is that it consumes a lot of mobile storage which pretty much makes it difficult for many people with comparatively less storage to download therefore i hope hoyoverse will try to do something about the storage issue all in all its a great game
5,super impressive gameplay love the level of detailing in ever single turn i take the gameplay the storyline is exceptional and i never expected it to be open world but that just makes it one hundred x better never in my life did i imagine a game like this on mobile you have blessed me thank you i only have one issue however when it comes to dialogues between characters side quest for this matter it takes up so much time having a skip button would be nice the lag on the europe server also bothers me
5,i like this game played it for more than two years played it since release till now i like the way that this game does not require ypu to play at long periods of time where you only have to do commissions dailies and events then logout you only need to login about ten minutes each day the story is good the gameplay and art is good and i really like the characters though the only down side is that it takes a long time to get characters you want it takes a lot of time to get enough pulls
5,suggestions hello devs i have a suggestion it would be nice if we can swiftly change our party to party with the click of a button long pressing the portrait allows to quickly configure the party setup but what if there is a button to switch between party and party without needing to configure the current setup and switch between characters that is necessary in certain situations that would be quicker and very useful it such a hassle sometimes to switch characters
5,i love this game with all my heart the story the graphics the gameplay the gatcha system may be flawed at times but by all means it is not an unfair game to free to play players exploring the map is amazing every update in regions is fantastic and exciting however it is a pretty time consuming game and it is very heavy on the phone last time i had it installed i basically had to delete everything else and the memory was still low
5,this turned out to be so addictive i love it you are always learning more about the storyline characters and different kinds of currency and items it is easy enough to progress through the levels but not to the point it is boring i love all the different achievements cooperative mode all the collections it is amazing gamelplay too not overwhelming with the controls and settings but offers all you need this is especially important to me
5,this is by far my favourite game i love the storyline the places the characters the design the only issue is that genshin is not at all new player friendly if you were to start playing now four i think it would be overwhelming mostly because in order to level up a character you need certain resources from places that could take a long time to unlock and you should not rush other than that i really really enjoy genshin
5,it is very fun and i really love the graphics and the details of each every characters but it frustrates me that the resin is so low and takes a long time to restore which is having to wait for a whole day or just spend primo for resin and the storage of the game is increasing which some players cannot continue playing this game but overall i really enjoy it and keep up the good work
5,freaking amazingg it definitely consumes a lot of storageprobably almost forty gigabytenow on mobile but i would say it is pretty worth it the story lines characters voice acting everything about it is so cool the graphics and the design too a really cool game that you can decide to play alone or with friends it is pretty fun and addicting and highly recommend it to those who want fighting lore games
5,super great game hi early one of the best on mobile it does take a really super long time to download data and start the game up but that is not the apps fault all in all the game is really great graphics are incredible the music is honestly some of the best the character design is chefs kiss it is such a worth while game if you give it the time
5,i love this game it has beautiful graphics characters and animals maybe the sounds that the characters make are a bit perverted but it is bearable i also like that we get free stuff on start maybe the daily tasks are starting to get a bit boring and monotonous but for primo i will do anything cut scenes are really great all the effects that are there are refined animation deserves a nobel
5,i love this game there is just requests can you maybe make the game to not take up too much storage that would be really helpful when it is saying downloading resources and stuff like that could you please make sure that when you close the app but it is in the background keep updating because i still have not been able to finish that unless i keep that on my screen other than that highly recommended
5,i have been playing since january of twenty twenty one the game is absolutely captivating the visuals the story line down to time limited events the musical score the music in this game deserves an award from being real world regional correct and being unique is absolutely amazing some people say the dialogue is too long for me it is not enough i love learning about this fantasy world and it is lore i wish the usage of the voice actor would increase than read only dialogue that is my only gripe
5,this is a really good app and they fix your problems no matter what but i do have a problem that needs fixing i have been sending reports about the problem the problem is that it crashes paimon says do not go there or we will explore that area latter and there is glitching sounds and after that happening for a good few seconds it makes a bell sound and it acts up so much and it has been going on for months i sent at least or four reports please fix this in the future at least ty
5,this game is just perfect the characters are so beautiful and have beautiful animations i really like the story and how it is not only put through words but also cut scenes i have been obsessed since day and barely took any breaks the puzles and hidden teleport waypoints are really annoying but it also makes it pretty interesting recommend the game it is easy to understand most of the things
5,super amazing graphics this game has amazing quality plus you do not have to purchase anything unless you want to be extra edit although some of the loading can take a while especially the first second loading it is worth it the graphics and sound effects are incredible edit i cannot play anymore because of insufficient storage space i have deleted so much stuff but still not enough i ended up deleting the app but will attempt to redownload it with my new phone hope it works
5,love the design and user interface awesome char design and world building a few tiny cons the archer controls are not that good there is no sneaking aiming lacks accuracy as well as movements on narrow surfaces like a fallen trunk dialogues have choices but so far most have the same result its a heavy install just the update took eight gigabyte but all in all i love it
5,this is one of the best games i have played so far though my only problem is that the damage numbers do not show up and it is really annoying especially whenever i try to showcase my characters i still have to change devices just to see numbers and it is such a hassle because setting my devices up takes a long time i do not really mind at most times although if you can please find a way to fix this bug
5,great graphics the music department is absolutely amazing the mechanics are easy to understand the characters have different personalities the stories are good despite this it has its flaws after you have finished the story there is almost nothing to do especially when there is resin that further limits your activities and takes long time to refill only one end game content nothing to keep you hooked after you finished main story and the devs does not seem to listen to its community
5,genshin impact is one of my favorite games overall there is so much to do the storyline is simply amazing and it really pulled me in when i started from building characters to exploring the world the possibilities are pretty ranged and the cooperative system is very cool i have met a lot of people throughout the year of playing and i am extremely satisfied you will need to put in a lot of time and effort to progress since the quests ex archon quests story quests hangouts are really long
5,it is just perfect the design the graphics the voice actors everything i love the stories and characters in there the only problem is lag whne i first start genshin during the day for the first time it gets a little laggy and it is not because of my internet connection usually i would have to quit then rejoin to be able to play without any lag other than that everything is great and i especially love the three point zero update thank you for creating this game mihoyo and great work
5,the game in general is the best i have ever played in terms of adventure fighting scenery events etc the only thing i would like to be changed is the space it takes to run if we are unable to replay story quests and scenes it should be reasonable to have an option to delete those extra unused files to have more space other than that best game out there
5,i never liked to play mobile games and cross platform did not seem viable to me but this game made me change my mind it plays well on mobile and pc and has a really good gradual introduction of gameplay features maybe even a bit to gradual slow but maybe that is trying to enjoy it to the max and trying to every sidequest before moving on it is just great and really well made addictive as well but that is what a good game should be and it is hard to not be tempted to play when i should work
5,i absolutely love and adore this game by far my favorite story roleplaying game out there the quests lore plots mysteries grind pulls all of it i am a newer player but i have not been bored yet of this game i do not think i ever will i would say it is biggest issues is lagging and setting it is quality different on its own as well as occasional bugs on my laptop if the frame per secondfps could be a bit quicker that would be great but other than that the game is beautiful will update
5,this game is absolutely awsome i have been playing it for two months now and i must say i became addicted i love the graphics and the quality and the voice actors but there is something that i would like to be changed leveling up your adventure rank is quite hard and slow that sometimes i lose hope and the artifacts thingy is not quite explained during the game so i had to rely on other resources to understand so i would like an explanation from them plus for the leveling up to become easier
5,really awesome game i play it almost everyday the graphics story character designs mechanics the overall contents of the game are impeccable the only problem is it tends to crash on my device whenever i enter multiplayer especially during domains other than that this is one of the best games i have ever played and you will get addicted faster than james charless career flopped
5,this is a great game from the graphics and the map everything is perfect idea though i feel like it is kind of ironic that the main character is of the weakest characters in the game i think it might be interesting if as they explore the nations they gain more elements they can control instead of just switching and becoming more powerful
5,the characters places soundtrack storyline the world itself top notch seriously its unique and amazing it is a single player game but after reaching a certain rank you can join with your friends in cooperative mode definitely worth it and i had a beautiful experience but the game is little hard to play it can be tiring and might feel like a chore at some point but overall it is great they have done lots of research for the characters places names etc which is very impressive
5,i do really like this game i just wish it did not have to take up so much space it can be very laggy at times during any scene with the dragon in mondstat it would constantly flash random colors of blue and purple because of how badly it affects my storage and how poorly it runs on mobile i had to delete it overall pretty good based on what i have seen if these problems can be resolved i would give it another try
5,fun addicting and spectacular the storyline is gripping the worlds beautiful and the enemies varied the puzles are awesome and they sometimes have unexpected solutions the soundtrack is just enchanting this is my favourite game ever i just wish it was easier to get characters and that the resin system was not in place that is honestly the worst thing about the game in my opinion however i still absolutely recommend you download it
5,it is great i get lost in the battles and exploring new places on the map almost like playing on a pc good job aside from the massive download and space it took up on my phone it is playability and fun adventures make up for it the only issue i had so far was my phone warming up to fix the issue i just lowered the refresh rate it was set too high over clocking my phones prosessors since then i have had no issues great game worth it thanks for your time sincerely me
5,the game and story is fun and addicting but once you are done with all of the quests in the game there is basically nothing left to do it is still good though the play style of each and every character is unique and the music choice is calm and relaxing it is soothing to listen to i love it the map is massive and there is tons of chests to get no problems in the game so far in my opinion pretty fun and addicting at the same time i will continue supporting this company in the future
5,the characters are great and their abilities are useful i like the fact that you can venture around by foot teleportation or by flying and see other areas i found it easier to buy items and potions to help upgrade my weapons and characters without having to use real money to do so the game quality is great and i have had no trouble hearing the voice characters i also like the fact that i can test against some harder level enemys without being restricted
5,controls gameplay and graphics are all five stars but i am only rating it four stars because of the systems that are unoptimized they have to fix their resin system and the way that you can only progress with resin they have to add more ways to spend our time in the endgame because it is only a five minute playtime once you get to the higher level in short more content and better systems
5,in my opinion this is the best open world mobile game taking into account the graphics the storyline the visuals the character arcs and the smooth game play experience mobile players will inevitably face some backlashes like lag heat up or game crash but from personal experience it is not so bad that one cannot play smoothly for hours moreover the in game experience is so lively and engaging and even if you do not spend money on the game it is actually really fun
5,have not seen annoying ads yet the graphics even in my low end phone is superb the controls and settings are highly customizable the main story and other stories are good and well made character npcs animation is mesmerising and a good way to spend quality time with your loved ones especially in this time where global pandemic is a threat
5,this one game is so great i love it the only thing that is the cutscenes are not skippable talking about non skippable it consumes some storage and battery throughout the process cutscenes it also lags somehow if we then have an option to skip it perhaps there should also be some titles before the cutscene starts so we would be able to browse it instead on reliable sources anyways this game is immersive
5,hi mihoyo i likelove genshin impact it is really cool i love exploring in the game graphics so wonderful realistic views nature and many more i just have one problem can you put a feature in which we can send primo to our friends also mora if this feature is added then it would be an outstanding game of exploration thank you in advance
5,as far as phone games go and furthermore a free phone game i am really impressed entertaining engaging and lots of stuff to do graphics are great kinda reminds me of breath of the wild but with more border contrast i exspected it to be like breath of the wild actually but the party aspect of the game play changes everything i really enjoy it
5,an immersive large in game world and the best part its open world you are not locked to a line of locations instead you can climb mountains go fishing fight enemies and have a great time artifacts may only be the main problem as there is always the difficulty of acquiring desired artifacts otherwise this game is great in all sorts of ways and it will set you back nothing to begin playing
5,i have been addicted to this game ever since i started playing it the characters the stories and overall the concept of the game is really beautiful but i do have suggestion though there are times that i accidentally exit the app during or after a cutscene due to real life matters so when i open the game once again i have to repeat the whole cutscene again it would be a great help if cutscenes have a skip button so we can get straight to the point without repeating the whole scene again
5,this game is very addicting indeed it is free and all and has amazing characters places animations voices music and cut scenes the only thing is when i update it it takes half of my storage rather than that everything is very addicting the characters gameplay and everything really i cannot really say anything else and i do not really have any problems with it either but it is a very amazing game and i hope for the future updates and character releases
5,congrats for winning in the best mobile games the game is enjoyable the overall gameplay and the game itself is excellent i will highly recommend this game to my friends however the game runs smoothly at first but after thirty minutes it starts to slow down this happens every time i play i suggest to have a setting that decreases or increases your render distance we appreciate the view of dragonspine from liyue but it is not necessary to view if you are surrounded by treasure hoarders a slider of render distance might help our gameplay much smoother and better i believe this change or related change will get better reviews of the game i hope you understand congratulations
5,addictive watch out or this game will take all of your time and maybe some of your money it is a bit difficult to play on mobile much easier on a game console like playstation where there is definition between buttons it also drives me a bit crazy that i have to keep zooming out again and again but the game is well done graphics are great i have not had any problems except that i seem to spend too much time playing it was made in china and they are probably getting data from this game
5,it is a good game i will not lie i have been playing it for a couple weeks but eighty of the gameplay is traveling yes you can teleport but you will not collect any items if you do that walking is really slow and running is limited it would be nice if we could ride something like horses or an original animal also dying in water is the worst could we use boats or something else
5,very good game good quality graphics music and story to the point that it touches my heart really like the regions so far and look forward to more content of course there can be some improvements made such as the occasional grammar errors and random glitches but considering that this is such a huge game it is hard to patch all the bugs
5,the game has a lot of content when you begin although it may become a little bit stale after a while the music the appearance the gameplay the characters and the story is very good allowing you to focus on what you want and not just in combat the teapot system has improved and is fun to personalize and with five characters with amazing design voice lines and distinct personalities you will end up having more than one favourite i really recommend the game just be weary of the community
5,love it the story is super interesting the art and animation are wonderful i love the game dynamics even though there is a bunch of stuff that is really hard on mobile i can cooperative with friends if i want to it can get a little slow sometimes i have not run out of story yet but i am currently stuck till i level up hehe but when you can actually play it it is super enjoyable
5,this is an absolutely brilliant game it will take a few months to clear out the current content and the game is set to recieve updates for the next few years the only problem was that the anniversary rewards were not great this was a serious put off for a lot of players but this does not directly affect the game play experience whatsoever especially for a new player overall the beautiful open world interesting storyline unique characters and amazing music make this a must try game for sure
5,this is an incredible game especially for it being free i know it has issues with being a bit stingy with rewards and sorting out parity between characters another issue is how much time you need to invest just to get a character or weapon fully leveled and their are a lot of characters there needs to be some way to fix this as it is not the only grind in the game you have to level up so much and you are not given enough resin energy to do this
5,great game overall the gameplay is great for a mobile game and the graphics are amazing the controls on mobile are pretty rough and there is no controller support for mobile the big issue is that mihoyo does not listen to people most of the time bug fixes are nerfs for characters that are meant to be low tier and they have not given quality of life improvements in about six months many of the events are attempts to drive fanart creation i love this game but do not recommend it
5,i have been playing for a year and really enjoy it they are constantly fixing issues and making the game more streamline along with adding new events characters and items it is different to play a game that is story is still in the works and being added with each new version but i do not mind the gradual reveal on top of the game being free they are always giving out stuff there is also absolutely no pay to win aspect
5,the company puts a great deal of effort into the game everything from design story game play events music etc etc the art style may be typical but the game offers more than what you would expect this past year i have enjoyed it thoroughly though of course there are some issues when it comes to the game such as resin and slow build up of primo overall it is a great game
5,pros excellent graphicswhen compared to other mobile games smooth gameplayconsidering the graphics a lot of area to explorefor new players and lot of things to keep you engaged cons it is a huge game approx gigabyte even if you play for like hr day you will run out of quests and things to do in a short period of time very very bad resin system it stops you from progressing in the game
5,love the game the music scenery and graphics are incredible for a free game i am yet to spend a penny on wishes etc and still have great characters that have all progressed if you are willing to put the time in which is made easier by the fun gameplay and great graphics then you will be able to have loads of fun without paying
5,really an incredible game with a dynamic start and a lot of content in the beginning it lack a bit as the player increase in level but the frequency of events and the very deep lore kinda make up for that plus there is still all the exploration part character building abyss and so on the gacha part is neither good nor bad and of course the game is beautiful and quite fun to play on pc at least
5,everything is so great about this game the music the scenery the graphics everythings just great it is just that the artifacts drop rate and the random substats upgrade are so annoying it literally take you months to get and build a good one and the resin system is so restrictive with the new bosses it would be much better to have more resins
5,this game is gorgeous and has a nice world to explore the combat is simple but has depth to it the characters are unique and interesting i look forward to seeing what this game will add in the future and keep exploring this expanding world edit the only things that could be improved are the supplies and the resin system zero point six drop rate for five is too low for my liking word of advice do not use standard unless you are fine with any character or weapon
5,this has been the game i have been constantly coming back everyday since the day it was released it has been a great escapism during all the craziness and quarantining at home due to the pandemic beautiful graphics fun characters and a stunning soundtrack i listen to even outside playing the game itself of course i have my complaints as well concerning the franchise listening more to the playerbase and their concerns but if they take note of issues i think it will continue to flourish
5,the game is pretty good on top of that they have high quality it is sometimes annoying while hunting or talking with the charters the voice gets fussy and glitchy so does the screen i do not quite understand the settings i hope you make the tutorial a bit easier to understand without these problems the game is amazing i recommend it if you like these kind of games have a great day
5,i love genshin impact but still it has it is own advantages and disadvantages first it is beautiful game the design of landscapes and characters is amazing second stories of even nps characters are cute and touching third there are many things to do daily tasks different events a lot of boses and dungeons to improve your playing skills however as a pc player it is hard for me to play on the mobile the graphic on the mobile version is lower and the controller is more complicated
5,the game is super satisfying and beautiful sometimes there is nothing to do reallybut that is to be expected from a platform with a lot of potential i suppose a lot of players are very upset at the mechanics which i am not sure about but i will not stop playing being quick at progressing is not the thing the company wants us to pursue but many players seem to miss this point it is the best experience ever if you are just looking to explore a new world and story also it is free
5,good game been playing since october last year i do not care bout the anniversary rewards it will not make me quit but i will not be spending again for a long while take out the resin system it really puts limitations i would love to grind hard for artifact stats since it has also a really bad rng i do not care about how repetitive the gameplay is every mmorpg i have played feels repetitive anyway i was attracted to genshin cos of the story lore and the art characters are just a plus
5,absolutely love the game the characters story line quests and the graphics are absolutely beyond my expectations it is certainly one of my favourite games of course its a different experience for everyone and unfortunately you will need alot of storage space for this which means it can run a bit slow at times probably just means you need to free up some room but otherwise i am in love with this gameten over tenrecommend
5,here is the thing i absolutely love this game the characters are super loveable the gameplay is fun ninefive of the time graphics are phenomenal but this is only on pc maybe console i have not played it on console yet if you try to play this on your phone or tablet you will be disappointed the controls are confusing it is constantly lagging graphics become very slow and pixelated so if you are planning on playing on pc or console go for it it is super enjoyable otherwise do not bother
5,this is the only game i have ever been obsessed with i love all the characters their design backstories idiosyncrasies quirks voice overs and more when away from the game to study for my exams i had their soundtrack playing in the background because even the osts are crazy good graphics music design even the advertising for the game is amazing
5,the game is excellent one of the best ones i have ever played for sure i do happen to have a recurrent issue since the two point zero update though at random times the game shuts and i have to restart the application and it is very annoying because it sometimes happens in the middle of a fight clearing cache usually fixes the problem but only for some time after a while the game crashes again genshin impact is the only application i have been experimenting this issue with any possible fixes
5,beautiful graphics cute characters and an overall fun and open world to explore and have fun in only problem is that my pixel xl cannot run it even on lowest settings without crashing known issue with the bad ram the phone has so i cannot play it currently until i get an upgrade or a computer even then i love this game and it is one of the current top games to play on any platform right now
5,an amazing game that i spend way too much time on it is not too hard for casuals but it also gives a good challenge for hardcore gamers it does not rely in an afk aspect and gives the player control of the gameplay which in my experience is a lot more fun it is a grind type of game though music has the emotional and distinct feel between regions you explore designs are detail oriented masterpieces and the open world gives the story the overall grandeur of a good time
5,i really like the story the characters the animation everything it has a really big potential and it is quite good to play earlier the sound glitching problems was more frequent now it became more rare also it is lagging sometimes i am not quite sure if it is my phones fault or the games fault but other than that it is one of my favourite game so far
5,i love this game it is litterally one of my favorite games in the world but there is one thing i play on computer i have a touchpad and a physical mouse i adjusted the sensitivity but genshin impact is still really slow with my mouse which affects my archery and how quick i can turn my screen i have tried settings but they only partly helped it is still really slow with my mouse i do enjoy the game though and i cannot wait for future updates
5,great game few issues with the combat system though its just tapping a button i would wish that there was more variation like maybe you could slide the attack button to the right and it would a specific attack so swiping to the right would repeat the same attack and swiping up would do a different attack etc and then you would have to find out combos on your own instead of just spamming attack and abilities also the late game becomes way too grindy but the start was a lot of fun
5,it takes a lot of time to load at first for me it took an hour but after that the next time it loads it is fast the graphics are everything the characters are voiced and you can tell that the people put effort into making this it is just a little glitchy when you have to fight stormterror as all i could see was just rays of colours and tip to the beginners do not just close the app there will be an option to exit click that or else your data will not be saved but overall it is a nice game
5,literally i am so addicted this game is amazing it is so smooth the graphics are amazing and the characters are all so well designed the story is immersive and the characters you meet along the way make the journey all the better i would like a feature where you could change your traveler but the game is doing just fine without it there is always so much fun events and the gacha system is so much better than other games i one hundred recommend it
5,i really love this game on android but can you please make an option for the movement control to be moveable as apposed to being fixed i have big thumbs and i am having so much trouble with character movements especially in battle having theability to place your thumb anywhere in the lower left quadrant to move would be great also having the camera move to follow your movement so it always gives you a view from over your shoulder or back would be helpful as well please and thank you
5,amazing game cannot believe it is a mobile game and free to play the storyline and side quest stories are all really interesting the characters are fun and all have very purposeful skills the design and music is lovely and adds a lot to the experience overall just a wonderful game that i have gotten addicted to really quickly a little repetitive when you have to farm for items but that does not detract much at all from the experience
5,beautiful details no ads at all fun gameplay multiplayer and i like how each reigion has its own story behind it all characters have their own skill and have good designs i like how there are details on the speed depending on how tall they are but some cutscenes will not actually play and will freeze up like the one on windbloom festival no matter how good your phone is in total the game is a perfect choice for people who like adventure fighting fantasy and multiplayer games
5,let me just start by saying i cannot believe that this is a mobile game the graphics are unbelievable the open world system is incredible the quests characters animations and everything about it is amazing it is very fun grinding for wishes trying to get a new character it gives the game at least one thing to do and to strive for constant updates and bug fixes and limited time events make it that much better if you are going to play do it go genshin impact please give me a five star star star star star
5,i have had a great experience with the game the story is great the way you grind for resources is great the graphics etc basically everything is great except things my phone heats up to dangerously high temperatures when playing it goes as high as fifty eight°c it is insane that is right where a phone battery can combust randomly i am using a redmagic six pro with the cooler and yet it heats up so much game drops frames as low as fps the censoring is very useless and unnecessary
5,i absolutely love this game the graphics storyline character and community is outstanding however when i went to log in today after about six months of playing my save data seemed to have reset if someone knows how to fix this please please let me know i have not deleted the app changed the email device or server
5,literally the best game ever i started playing it for the botw esque game play but quickly realized that this is far more than a simple copy and paste the graphics are stunning characters are well fleshed out and developed and the story is complex and gripping it combines strategy action and exploring in a masterful way that keeps me coming back the gacha system can be annoying but it makes getting special characters all the more rewarding tl dr get this game now
5,i usually get bored with rpg games or any game in general and tend to uninstall them after sometime but this game has kept me for more than half a year the storyline is interesting nice graphics and character designs if i have to nitpick on something its about the progress of the story a bit slow for my pace and phone capability wise it eats up a lot i mean a lot of memory well that is what we get for good graphics
5,this game is a must have if you enjoy story driven games with a lot of variety in abilities characters and again stories the sheer amount of side quests and commisions one can do for rewards is insane and the limited time events are just awesome though there are a few things that bug me like how i cannot go back to a previous dialogue choice when talking to someone outside of a quest instead of backing out of the conversation entirely it is only minor and is not worth bumping down to a four star
5,this is such an awesome game i totally recommend it if you enjoy doing puzles i usually always play this game in my free time to get away from reality although one downside is that sometimes when i am fighting enemies my camera angle always goes low and i cannot end up seeing at all and sometimes i keep climbing random trees or boxes and it is a little annoying but other than that it is an amazing and very well detailed game
5,redownloaded after a while and still one of the best games for mobile story is still amazing though it runs out of story content really really fast but for me the combat is kinda shallow i also noticed there is always a stutter from time to time and most appare not during combat it does not matter whats the graphical setting the frame will always stutter on occasion hope it will be fixed soon please and thank you midsummer isle event is super duper fun the exploration puzle solving was the best part
5,absolutely stunning game from graphics to gameplay to character design and story really ticks all the boxes for just about anyone i am also impressed that they got this to run so well on phones at the fidelity it is at i have already downloaded it three times on pc playstation and my phone eleven over ten would recommend to anyone
5,this is the best game out there but i am having problems with the new event windtrace i always rncounter a bug when i am the hunter i keep pressing capture but the rebels still escape even when they are literally in the capture circle some other rates tell about this bug to please fix it as soon as possible it makes the event less enjoyable as a hunter thank you
5,i downloaded it first because my friend kept nagging me to do so best choice ever the game has so many differents aspects that you will find one you will stay for the story is as great as the design and the cooperative system is really cool if you have friends to play with i totally recommend it beware you might get addicted and play ten hour per day to keep up with your friends it happened to me
5,i do not play this game on mobile since it is so heavy on my device and often causes it to overheat however i am an avid pc player of genshin impact and this game has got to be one of my absolute favorites the characters are almost all enticing the stories are fantastic and the designs even more so there are small things that need to be fixed like the resin system or the artifact hunting but honestly those are small things i highly recommend this game
5,nice storyline lots of adventure quests i am not a big game person but the controls are easy to adjust to and really easy to get into i play casually on the mobile version but this game is also good on pc you do not have to pay to level up your characters it can easily be done without there is new updates and lots of opportunities to gain primo and other resources
5,the game is great the lore is deep the story is compelling the characters are relatable and the scenery is beautiful and the combat and upgrade systems work wonders this is a five star review almost perfect game but it is hefty in the requirements to run it i have a year old phone and it runs with lag on the lowest settings this game was clearly built for stronger devices like pcs consoles and select phones but it is a drawback i will accept as it is my fault for lack of resources
5,i absolutely love it the graphics the elemental reactions and everything but there is one thing that i found there is a bug when trying to fight divalin stormterror there is another one with kaeya when i use his elemental skill on the water the ice does not appear but its there please fix these bugs sorry if i am asking for too much but overall the game is fantastic cannot wait for the new character
5,i love this game srsly from the character design over the story to the overall gameplay experience everything is just perfect it never gets boring since there are always new challenges events and quests for the gamer gamers have to think strategically before fighting enemies of different elements which makes it so much more interesting i recommend this game to everyone who likes adventures and rpg games
5,i have got to say this is one of the best arpg games that i have played so far immersive story that goes on a nice flow both the main and sub quests are well laid out the boss fights are nice and intense at times the controls are easy to understand and really like the regular events which add a bit of extra spice to the mix overall the graphics are top notch there are only a hand full of games that i can compare to its graphics there are a decent number of characters to choose from as well
5,this game is superb clearly deserves the awards they received good graphics great storyline the animation is really great and the content is worth the wait all the time a lot of people may complain about the unfairness of the game but i think it is fine since the developers aim to halt or slow down our progression especially when we are still on the tip of the iceberg there is still a lot of maps coming soon and i am excited for the future updates goodjob
5,my second best game i have every played nothing more to say its amazing one really annoying thing if i go out of the app just for a millisecond it resets the app i have to login and click play again that is super annoying but i am more of a pc player anyways still if you all can fix that it would be amazing edit please just add controller support for mobile i really need it and it should not be that hard right
5,i was skeptical at first but this game is a lot of fun it brings together all of the fun parts of rpgs in this amazing and beautiful world the quests and characters are interesting and even endearing at times the travel system is fantastic and i love being able to go just about anywhere you can see the combat is deceptively easy at the beginning but becomes quite challenging as you progress i especially love the ability to play on my phone or pc thank you mihoyo
5,super duper fun and intriguing to another level the graphics are top quality and absolutely stunning the soundtrack is so pretty and it fits the game very well the actual game play and storyline is really unique and interesting i also love that we have side quest options and its super easy to level up i would totally reccomend this game to anyone who likes adventures rpg combat and relaxing music this game gets a one hundred out of five from me all the way
5,not enough words to express how amazing this game is to me giant open world with tons to explor lots of different characters to mix and match on your team the graphics are amazing the scenery is so beautiful the music is just as gorgeous and there is so much lore the combat is smooth and strategic letting you switch your characters around in the middle of a fight to create combos using their elemental skills also you can cross play this game with friends or solo everything
5,it is a great game great graphics and i love the open world however i have two issues with the game it needs to be further optimized on my and poco x it faces fps drops in medium graphics there is nothing self learning in the game they teach you everything for example the puzles of the dungeons but other than that is an excellent game edit most of the problems faced in my previous review were solved the optimization impoved and also i was mesmerized with the game events
5,great exploration and a fun unique combat system the best controls and graphics i have seen on a mobile game also has a huge and detailed world the one real drawback is the gacha system which does not give good odds and gets very expensive very fast however ninety nine of the game content can be accessed without it if you easily get addicted to these types of games and feel like you have to collect everything you might want to stay away from this game because you can easily spend a lot of money
5,it is an incredible experience the visuals sounds and play are very beautiful and smooth that is even on some of the lowest settings the story line is well thought out and the characters are unique the combat system enforces the need to practice different tactics and character combos no oping through with a single one thank you for making this game free to play
5,this is by far the best rpg for mobile i have ever playedten over tengraphics gameplay story characters style and overall user friendly to get into it from the get go my and only complaint so far is not being able to use a controller touch controls are superb so no issues i am old school i guess and still like the choice and preference of using a controller my hope is that option becomes available in the near future as well as it being released to all gaming consoles
5,the game is great five stars for overall performance characters landscape quests mobs music weapons and overall playability the only problem with this game is that it takes a very fast and strong internet connection to play and takes a very long time to download initially everything is amazing and wonderful as long as you have good internet
5,so far i have been loving it it is better than botw ff and tes blades i am very impressed with how much they were able to cram into the game weapons magic dialogue cutscenes excellent physics and optional chores like cooking smithing and hunting it is all come together as though this is our first look at what a handheld console experience will look like on android and it is far better than i expected there is inventory map quests exploring fast travel puzles and arcade style combat
5,love this game there is no schedule so can play on your own time great story cute characters lovely scenery it is some times laggy mobile and there are some aspects that are harder like lag collecting and crystal butterfly and others move to fast to catch it is very time consuming to level all characters skills weapons as the materials are either random drops or to few but over all very good game
5,i started playing in late october twenty twenty i immediately fell in love with this game as soon as i started playing everything is amazing the graphics the design the map everything the gameplay is lovely though it sometimes lags while the cut scenes are playing it might just be my phone though but something i have noticed is that i cannot pick up things as fast not sure i it is just me but this has definitely been a wonderful experience looking forward to future updates mihoyo
5,an entertaining game with outstanding graphics and voice actors i love it it runs perfectly fine on mobile as mine meets or even goes over the requirements needed to run the game smoothly people complaining about how slow it is might be because their ram does not meet the requirement just a little problem with the storage space it takes but it is understandable if i want good graphics
5,very fun and lots to do amazing graphics and smooth gameplay only thing i would recommend would be to add more things to do for players whove completed all quests and have nothing to do in the mean time possibly more random events appearing besides that overall one of my top favourite games keep it up
5,the graphics show how far mobile gaming has come they compare to that of a console without overheating the device or much lag the interface is quite manageable albeit it can be hard to remember what is where also there are so many mechanics it can be confusing and overwhelming on what you might want to focus on at first my main issue is that it takes a long time to unlock many vital features but despite all this the game is certainly worth trying i enjoy this refreshing game
5,as a free to play all the way i understand the pain of playing this and aspiring to have insanely good characters but then it is totally enjoyable the visuals music even the lore it is just that we need events more often because once you get to the top rank it just becomes boring no more quests to complete
5,very engaging love the game but like most games the main storyline gets a bit grindy and you must be at a certain level to progress at certain parts this is mitigated by having a menu that will plot a bosses location on the map that has an item you need i think they should increase the amount of resin you can hold at once otherwise it takes forever to get all the items
5,great experience as a mobile game it is been a while since a mobile game has this much effort put into it it is a really fun open world gacha game with awesome graphics the gameplay is quite average as the controls in mobile are not as simple as the one in pc some transitions when going from one screen to another seems to be a bit buggy such as entering the wish area from the wish button sometimes keeps your adventure hud overall great game great potential needs more improvements
5,it is a really great game love it since i downloaded this game i do not have time for any other game and even if i play another game i do not feel as thrilling as i play this game it is challenging and the graphic the story the quests are absolutely well planner however i would give it a five if the promotional characters banner that already passed to be back again in the wish some people started late so they do not get the opportunity to pull for them a lot of people would pay for that
5,where do i start this game is amazing it has a nice and interesting storyline cool characters and honestly a pretty well made gacha game what i do not like is the lag for example if i am doing a quest and fighting something my whole screen suddenly freezes it would be nice if the creators would fix this but overall it is a pretty well made game
5,truthfully i did not know what to expect when i first downloaded this i was doubtful due to the large storage after version update the audio would sometimes lag but other than that i love the characters especially zhongli the graphics are decent but the effort put into the graphic design is most definitely astonishing other than storage and audio quality issue this game is amazing
5,this game is one of my favorite games of all time it includes open world experience which is something most people including me love it is an rpg so we get to level up our characters through work which i find very entertaining the design is incredible and so is the music i reccommend this game to everyone the plot is incredibly thrilling and funny a small piece of feedback is the resin it is not that the cap should be increased as it will take longer but the resin regen overall five
5,it is really good and of course super amazing but recently i encountered an issue and the game would crash by itself i would open it and at the start of the opening of the game it would crash instantly developers hear me out and try to fix this i am a fan of this game and lately the crash has been ruining it for me thank you edit they have fixed this issue thank you developers i am loving it so far
5,i really like this game overall best experience if you play in your computer since this game has amazing graphics it can be hard for your phone to show everything smoothly i think you should play it in a phone with a lot if storage i also like the characters and the system where you can go everywhere to even think a masterpiece like this is free still surprise me i really recommend this game
5,this a a true a game but free and on mobile the graphics are beautiful the gameplay is fun and plentiful the characters and enemies are varied and interesting this game has it all one of my favorites of all time and the two acts and regions in the game are only maybe twenty percent of whats to come the gotcha system is a little intense and kind of a rip off if i am being honest but i love it anyway eight over five keep up the great work
5,it is an anime style version of zelda breath of the wild i enjoy it because i love the cute and pretty art style and i loved the playstyle of breath of the wild lots of fun and you do not need to spend money to get far in the game i like that you can play on both pc and mobile for days when i am too lazy to set up my computer i have a very old pc that takes a bit to start running only critique is i wish there was more multiplayer things to do most quests cannot be done in multiplayer
5,what entices me about this game when it was first launched is the vast open world experience you can explore anywhere and all areas is not just imagery or backgrounds the music is fantastic and relaxing to listen to while you travel plus the storyline is engaging the characters are extremely well written and has their own quirks and flaws not to mention the npcs as well i love how detailed the game is too this will always be my favorite game
5,this is a really well made game with such good graphics on mobile the animated scenes are amazing in literally everything too the only problem for me is when fighting a lot of hilichurls the sound quality goes way down but that could be fixed with some headphones plugged in or turning the volume a bit low and then it is all good i really recommend this game
5,definitely the best free online game i have ever played everything about it is amazing the graphics are just amazing and this game definitely deserves more attention and support no problem with the game so far as long as you have a good phone or pc but i do have request though i wish that every month or two the chests except luxurious will reset i hope your character can hang out date with some of the npc or the playable characters just for fun and more storyline
5,my experience this far has been enjoyable i love the art style and character voices interaction gameplay on mobile has been easy to use and the experience on pc is just as enjoyable wishing seems a little hazy during the early game music is enjoyable and flows from exploration to combat and back again with excellent transitions create your account before you login with a google account if you want any sort of cross save functionality that was not clear so i ended up starting over on pc
5,this is the best mobile game i have ever played it is immersive and the developers have played a massive attention to detail the graphics are beautiful and stunning the gameplay is fluid and responsive i love the elemental aspects like ice freezing water and fire being interactive with the world a few things i would say if possible is to try and make the facial features of the characters move more accurately for more immersion i also love that the game is not pay to win but pay to have fun
5,excellent game however i found i cannot play this game on my phone pixel three because the frame rate is so bad even at low settings it works perfectly on both my ipad and pc so that is not a huge problem it looks better on them anyway and i think it is the best android game of twenty twenty hands down full of content and hidden locations full voiced cutscenes epic boss fights yeah it is great
5,genshin impact has blown my mind away i admit game size is pretty huge and you devs will not believe the eagerness and adrenaline that rushed through my body waiting for the download to finish then the door opened the cinematics are well done and the story quests characters environment and gameplay are all fantastic i can see the problem people are having with the graphics going bad sometimes and hope it gets fixed sound bugs are there too nevertheless so far best game in play store
5,you hit the free to play grind eventually unfortunately but this is a surprisingly good game that exceeds expectations for a legend of zelda breath of the wild clone apart from the free to play issues which are not as bad as a lot of games the biggest problem is a lot of missed potential related to multiplayer the invite system makes it very hard to find anyone who wants to play story cooperative and power levels differ too widely for it to make sense in many cases when even allowed
5,it is one of the best game on mobile i ever played only downside is a high power consumption and overheating my phone xiaomi mi eight pro so i cannot play longer then hour straight and have to let my phone to cool down i believe that it is not an issue on latest devices with more advanced cooling system over all excellent game with great graphic controls and story
5,love this game it reminds me so much of final fantasy game in game play but the best part is that you can be different characters and not just stuck with the main also it seems to have no end to events and game quest although the camera could use a little more work when fighting enemies but otherwise i like the overall control and game play story is also not hard to follow
5,what breath of the wild should have been i play on pc mostly but use my samsung phone have not had the lag or sound issues some have stated to play when not home definitely easier with a mouse and keyboard but the phone option is great to have and runs well this is one of the better games i have played of the type even comparing to console games cooperative could be better more to do but that is the only real change i would make to it
5,beautiful graphics a perfect eye candy immersive background music and sfx comfortable controls user friendly interface easy to learn great physics and logic and whatnot i have never seen anything like this before very innovative ten over ten i hope spending hours of playing and grinding is still better than pay to win though because that makes the game worth playing and earning achievements over time
5,incredible i am not sure what i was expecting when downloading this game but it has exceeded every expectation my highlights immersive story gorgeous character and world design huge open world map with loads to discover genshin impact plays much more like a console game than a mobile game while there are in app purchases they are completely optional i actually cannot believe how many hours i have played so far without making a dent and completely free at that i highly recommend
5,absolutely deserving of its title as a a game mobile based or not a fully realized open world with lore hiding in every corner characters who feel important to the plot and each with their own storyline puzles challenges and so much to do the only things taking away from the experience is the extremely low drop rate of nearly every high tier resource the restrictive resin system and the terrible drop rate scaling from early game to late game
5,well speaking of mmorpg i have played many games so far but genshin impact attracts me the most the texture and gameplay is smooth enough to be played in a fair and side this games color contrast and graphics are beyond and to be available in mobile its a big deal we got there but me and my friends have found many bugs on the list hope it will be fixed soon
5,one of the most fun mobile games i have played runs super smooth on galaxy ten e i love the variety of character abilities and play styles it is great to have cross platform so i can also play on pc controls are significantly easier on pc to dodge jump backwards off a ledge then glide back towards it or maintain enemies in camera mobile works well you just will not ever be as adept without a keyboard mouse it is fun for a couple hours then take a break so you do not burnout
5,i do not know if this is a bug but me and my friend started to play the opening cinematics had in game audio once the game started when i was roaming around my friend and i noticed the in game audio was gone after the cinematics i hope this can be fixed right away update fixed it so far i am loving the story even subquests it is really a change of phase i feel immersed into the story and land of genshin impact more power to the developers
5,i have tried a lot of mobile games and i am going out of my way to rate this the definitive open world rpg experience available on a phone the graphics and soundtrack are stunning and unlike those fancy but effectively unplayable pc mmo ports this is made for single player and intuitive touch controls the world is a bit girlish and difficulty rather on the casual side but there is so much love and beauty in this game that this actually makes it all the more enjoyable to explore recommend
5,this game is amazing i am just gonna get this out of the way from the simple controls to the cutscenes to the characters i love every single one of them yet the game is not perfect i found a glitch where i got stuck in the climbing position on a building and could not get down and i play on a google pixel xl and the audio seems to glitches and is choppy some of the time overall this is an amazing game and i highly recommend it it is more of a bigger app around eight gigabyte still very worth it
5,the graphics are gorgeous the gameplay is incredibly smooth and i love that there is no wrong way to play you can almost ignore story quests in favor of smaller side quests if you want and as someone easily distracted i love not being penalized for not following the rules there is also zero requirement to spend money for an enjoyable experience so you are also not penalized for being unable to shell out tons of cash just to play love love love this game
5,best gacha game out there great graphics over all and totally free to play spending money is a choice to just speed up the process with just free characters that are well built actually doing well in the game is not hard at all however i would suggest that the mobile users are able to change button placement on the screen ability to change hud layout as it will definitely help out the mobile users to aim better with bow characters and have abit more comfort when playing the game
5,before the game freezes during cooperative domains and the ninth floor of the abyss making the abyss unplayable after the update the freezes were a thing of the past new events are being added at a regular and manageable interval and the events do not stack so it is not a hassle unlike other games controls are still a bit iffy still cannot edit button layouts and there are still some bugs on xinyans skill they also added the single slot hotbar for pots i requested so kudos overall great update
5,the game itself is amazing wonderful graphics cute characters nice storyline the only thing i have to say is the lag i have a samsung aseventy and every single time i get to the part where my character and amber are looking at the sky after the wing thingy itnfeezes and the audio cuts out i do not know if it is a internet connection thing a bug or my phone simply cannot support the game edit i after i redownload the game it worked perfectly
5,the game is amazing the graphic are amazing for this being a phone game the controls and gameplay are very smooth my one problem is when the characters talk there is a little buz to it like the sound is too loud for my speakers i have even turned down my volume and put on ear buds but its the same result overall the game amazing
5,fantastic game so far controls are great graphics are even better some glitches here and there but they are getting fixed as the game progresses and new content comes in quite frequently there are ways to quickly farm in game currency primo so that even if you are not willing to spend money on it you will still be able to obtain good characters only gotcha it is difficult to be really effective with this combat system so be prepared to study and experiment a bit
5,i really enjoy this game so far i am usually not into games like this on a phone just because i think the controls are tricky but this game does it really well for the mobile devices it is really easy to understand visually appealing easy to get into the soundtrack and voice acting are both done really well the controls are easy one hundred percent recommend
5,i really enjoy this game so far graphics are amazing and the world exploring makes it hard to ever get bored the only issues i have had so far is that it heavily lags especially during battles and it will quit on me even when i have just started it up i have invested a lot of time in it but i find it hard to continue if it will just shut down on me like this so hopefully that gets fixed soon
5,so i am just going to say it this is probably the best open world rpg i have ever played on a phone the moment i realized it might be is when i started playing and saw there was no stupid auto button for combat and questing i am immediately out when i see that option there are a few things that could be improved like the controls can be a little frustrating at times especially the right thumb controls and the world could use more random enemy npcs other then that it is a must play
5,this is by far the best open world game i have ever played the heroes are very likeable and battle mechanics are quite understandable the storyline is very admirable and the voiceover of the hero is beautiful even the graphics is pretty i played many games like this but so far it is graphics is among the most beautiful i only have one problem the lag is unbearable i have to exit the game and reconnect again because it causes lag after some dialogue but anyway five stars for you devs
5,absolutely gorgeous although my phone is quite old and is not able to support the cutscenes it lags quite a bit i am still very happy with this game it takes up a lot of space but the graphics make up for it the game plays beautifully on your phone for main archon quests of course some boss quests and challenges are better played on pc but that does not mean you cannot have fun on mobile all in all a breath taking experience that i still love
5,it is a very fun game it does take a whole lot of time to download the data in the beginning but it allows you to leave the app it sends a notification when its done the story is very interesting and you actually have many missions and challenges to do they also tell you how to defeat knew enemies that you have not been with i love this game totally recommend it
5,to be honest a game like this should not even require you to use internet connection since it is more like solo game like legend of zelda and cooperative just gives you the option whether or not you want to play with your friends or other players also the game needs some optimization since it does not really run smoothly even at low graphic settings with mid range phones so it is more likely more compatible and smooth to play with a highspec or gaming phone still i love the game superb for mihoyo
5,i play this on both phone and pc really fantastic open world game very similar to zelda beautiful graphics and interesting characters and enjoyable combat system gameplay its more difficult to play on phone than on pc the only downside is that while the game is fully cross play it is not fully cross save this means i cannot log in and play my phone pc account on my playstation i hope when the game is released on nintendo switch that the cross save feature is available
5,great controls great gameplay great progression flow great story great characters great world the game is carefully crafted for an exquisite balance i can say it is a reflection of the purest forms of art that resonate with the human soul it is like your favorite books and your favorite songs all in one now it has a few problems monetization being the worst absolutely ridiculous scheme you would have better odds of getting a character by selling your soul to a devil ad astra abyssosque
5,spoiler alert i must say it is a very good game but now i am having difficulties i do not mind the lag but when using the bow i cannot move the sight meaning i must get out of the aiming stance and change my line of view and for the dragon it somewhat glitched out and blocked my view it probably because of my current device since i do not see anyone else is having this issues still a good game with a wide area to explore i just hope this get fixed since i am now stuck at the dragon fight p
5,it is the newest best game i have ever played first off the artstyle and the world looks real great i am pretty sure that was hard work paying off second was the characters their voice and their personalities and lastly the game itself was great and wholesome best game in a long waited while edit the update is great we get to see a new story and the continuasion of the archon problem but i really want to find a way to redo missions and cutscenes without having rewards is that possible
5,extremely fun amazing story unbelievable graphics the only problem but might only be my internet or phone is that it lags nonstop which makes it much harder to kill and climb move around the stamina and damage taken still go at normal speed but movement speed is limited the skill cooldowns also goes much slower but time challenges go at regular speed that makes the challenges almost impossible if you can fix it this game would literally be perfect otherwise i still recommend ninety nine ninety nine
5,seriously awesome i am a sucker for these anime inspired adventure games sadly my pc is trash but it works ok on my phone the only problem i have is the lack of controller support i was suprised to find out that my phone controller did not connect it seemed like the game that would have it sucks that my fingers are in the way of the beautiful graphics i hope in new updates they will include it
5,i just love the fact that this is a full console game that is working perfectly on my midrange aseventy the game itself is awesome immersive and detailed combat system is great but could use some refinement the only thing that is a little bit annoying is how the camera moves around on it is own during a fight since i am only using a touch screen not a joystic it is hard to keep adjusting the camera mid fight
5,you can tell a lot of love and money went into the game the graphics are gorgeous and there are surprisingly deep storylines even in the side characters if you have seen a trailer then go ahead and expect that level of detail in the actual game aim controls can be a little tricky on mobile and sometimes sound quality might dip a bit during action sequences i am using a galaxy ten but otherwise good gameplay highly recommend
5,this maybe one of the best games i ever played the graphics controls and everything however i wish there was more content in the game more quests and more accessibility to other characters to try them out and have more fun the cost of upgrading everyone is just not possible and i wish there was a messaging system with other players without going into cooperative mode
5,best mobile game i have ever played i cannot believe it is free it does have breath of the wild vibes but it is definitely a game of its own it has an in depth story gameplay and visuals i have enjoyed playing it so much i downloaded it for my computer and i plan on getting the nintendo switch version one released the continuous support and update of the game is great as well if you always wanted the console experience on your phone definitely download this game and give it a try
5,i do end up playing this game ninety nine percent of the time on my windows computer but having the choice to login on one platform or the other alone whenever it is convenient makes it such a wonderful experience this game is clearly inspired on botw when it comes to visuals and climbing mechanics however the fighting mechanics are a lot more fun and much much deeper elemental reactions lots of gear to boost different status changing between four characters on the fly to come up with some crazy tactics amazing and enticing story line with interesting characters the pity system ensures you can always get new characters even if you are just a free to play player you can get away with also only investing around thirty minutes a day in the game if you are a busy person and get all the most crucial stuff done and did i mention you can cross play with windows and playstation players it is just such a pleasant experience to group up with friends and explore the world no matter where they choose to play as long as they are from the same server region at least the fact that your character is stuck to the server you have created it in is my only real major complaint
5,this is game is amazing i really love the quality i play it on my note ten phone the only downside is that the controls are difficult to use when trying to aim and shoot an arrow i just wish it would auto align because for a phone its just too small to control it well if you know what i mean overall its a great game it makes you think and solves puzles i like that the puzles are not that hard and that they reward you with a special scene if you get it right it flows with a story
5,for a free to play game you are getting a huge amount of actually really good gameplay putting aside the gacha system which you definitely should investigate a little before getting into the game it is beautiful interesting enough and depending if you stay on your phone or change to pc or console challenging enough as well it does have problems after several hours of gameplay in terms of what you can do but if you are a casual player you will not even notice them do give it a try
5,after a month plus of playing all i could say about this game is that it is amazing astonishingly gorgeous the play style is smooth and unique the characters are different and have their own stories and quests the background music was just heavenly truly a breathtaking experience when you explore throughout this vast wonders not to mention the graphics the design and art style of the game not much of a pay to win in a case most rpg games do definitely deserves a five star
5,progressive game play wonderful visuals loads of stuff to do and easy to follow instructions have yet to try team play only two things i do not like there is no way to get reverse vertical camera control on android as far as i know and i really dislike when you reach the edge of the area you are currently allowed to explore and you are just propelled back rather than a more natural barrier like a too high cliff for your current stamina level overall a great game i like
5,this is a beautiful well made and immersive single player game i have been playing for a few days so far exploring the world and interacting with countless objects people and places and kicking some enemy hide the adventure level which is seperate from character level stunts your growth somewhat forcing you slow down and enjoy every aspect before moving up a tier this is a free to play console worthy masterpiece and thoroughly recommend to anyone looking for a solo rpg in near mmo style
5,genshin is a great game if you take the time to be smart with your resources and plan correctly a lot of people complaining probably are not doing that and are spreading their resources thin between every character they have i stuck with my core four characters from adventure rank forty and i have not had any issues with gameplay difficulty graphics are great i love that it is a cross platform game that i can play on my pc or phone when i am on the go i am looking forward to future content updates
5,voice and animation clips are great a good non auto rpg that players can explore the world and gain good items my only issue is that when you aim a target with a bow it is somewhat hard to center a target takes time to aim due to difficulty to control even if i set up the sensitivity option same as to run and walk i hope their is a mini shortcut that enables to run walk without overdoing the controls other than that it is a great game thanks for bringing it up
5,the game is fantastically rich in detail and i have yet to get sick of climbing up everything and jumping off to glide long distances the only problem so far is that the archery controls are really awkward to use outside of puzles at least on mobile platforms hitting anything is maddening if you need to move aim charge the attack and then hit a rapidly moving target
5,i love the style and atmosphere of this game in many ways it reminds me of breath of the wild one of my faves however some aspects are improved like the cooking and the fact that once you collect a certain weapon it will not break the one thing i am most impressed with is how much they reward you for exploration i tend to just hunt for teleport wards and so along the way i find lots of camps and treasure i really recommend this game but just beware you need a device that can manage data
5,overall really good and fun game the graphics are amazing the game can get really laggy at random times though i also had a lot of problems when first downloading it it either kept failing or would glitch out and restart the download for the rest of the content it was really frustrating but i really wanted to play so i kept trying i feel like if you were not dedicated to wanting to play the game then the download at the start would be a huge deterrent as well as the lagging during game play
5,i am honestly having a great time with the game the primo you all freely give out were more than enough to give me most of the characters i wanted so that is pretty cool one problem i have been having is that my game often times closes unexpectedly after just a few minutes of playing hopefully this is a problem on the games end and not because of my admittedly kinda trash phone other than that keep up the good work you all
5,it is relatively new so i allowed for some grievances my rating is based strictly on my enjoyment of gameplay characters power system and story however the game still has a few bugs to iron out you may not experience any difficulty on a flagship samsung or iphone ect but just keep in mind it requires good phone specs for the best experience and to minimize the chance of bugs or crashes also i am surprised to see it is not pay to win can progress for free but you will want to buy stuff
5,its an amazing game the graphics are so adorable the game play is good and the story is even better i realized that if you go into the other areas there are not any voice acting and it is not as fun maybe if you all fixed those parts maybe put in some more chapters to the stories some voice acting make the map larger or put in another element the character can learn i feel like that would make the game so interesting amazing game keep up the good work
5,a great free world experience with many things to do vast map to explore many quest to do the graphics is great but there is some refinement issue with certain not so smooth experience if combo attacks have been given then that would have been great yet the attacks are on par there is some issue in item pickup with late response and delayed command which can be improved with coming updates good recommendation
5,this game is a masterpiece from the visuals to the gameplay every sequence is perfect i have never played a game this good looking and smooth on android try charging ambers arrow and shooting it at a random open place you will see it falling all the way to the very end simply amazing people who are complaining about levelling up in the future stage should remember how difficult it was to level up in final fantasy on the ps back then we did not even have any paid transactions
5,loving it the graphics are amazing the story plot is engaging all in game missions and other activities are not repetitive the voice actors characters are just so well rounded finally you can do whatever you want while playing to be honest explore cook mine hunt help people by doing random quests get to know the city and teyvat in general read books farm etc last thing the animation is just so smooth and pretty i cannot say enough about genshin it is everything i wanted in a game
5,really well done mobile game that is better than most console games really fun open world with actual fighting tactics using different elemental combinations only issue is some frame rate slowdowns that do not fix themselves without exiting the game it takes a long time to first load up but loading is miniscule after one recommendation is to have more variety of weapon drops as i have not changed weapons because i have only ever seen one purple one gifted to you
5,very addictive in a good way it feels like a breath of the wild expansion the game so far does not feel like a pay to win after quite a few hours of gameplay i have not needed to store at all i happily bought a pass from the store though the storyline is solid and has voice over the only downside so far is the adventure rank system it is not much of a downside but it levels kind of slow the game needs costumes to and an easy way to talk to other players online these are minor issues
5,like playing a console game to pc players i mean no offense that is a major compliment for a game on a phone from me i have other games on my phone of course but this is the first time i have encountered a game that i can play when i am not at home without a switch or laptop just a phone and still get that feeling of a full game experience the animation styles voices story cut scenes fighting style abilities amount of characters unlocking new characters exploring shows the work
5,game itself is not bad so far but it is basically unplayable on my pixel three xl it constantly freezes for a good five to ten seconds just play the game on a pc update nineteen oct twenty twenty gave it another shot and it runs smoothly in certain areas and without rain do not go to cities or else it will freeze up and rain causes lag as well still needs improvement but overall loads of fun even on single player
5,i absolutely love this game it is the best experience you can get for mobile when it comes to open world games it controls nice and the user interface is done amazingly though i do tend to have an issue with accidentally pressing and holding the attack button when trying to move the camera but it does not ruin the experience the only feature i would recommend adding is offline play as that would make the game more accessible to people though that is my opinion
5,super amazing game there is no auto mode which i extremely appreciate in games like these you do everything yourself from fighting collecting materials cooking etc the story is great the voices and animations are fantastic there is always something to do it is just such an addictive game my only advice to make the game even better is to add a more hands on cooperative mode so you could do quests with friends and add an openworld aspect to where you can see add and talk to other players
5,an overall amazing experience i love the mechanics of the game such as the combat cooking and gliding it is similar to botw and i love the aspects similar to it like the climbing amazing graphics amazing storyline the controls are great everythings nice and organized definitely my favorite free to play game of all time
5,this game is amazing the graphics the story the characters everything i cannot stop playing it however i think some features can be added to better the experience i suggest you include a trading system between players another thing i heard from a friend is that the enemies levels be averaged with the partys rather than adventure rank finally another thing to include is a chat log in case if the player misses any important dialogue
5,in my honest opinions the game plot characters movements and even their reactions are well made my only problem is that at certain cut scenes the video got lag and only the sound went well maybe it was my phone cause it could not handle the graphics other than that the game itself is very enjoyable player friendly very kind in helping players and i got addicted playing it on first day playing it
5,great game so far which i would say easily surpasses most mobile games i have played the controls on a mobile screen are sometimes hard to work with but it is great that you can play this game on a pc as well to help mitigate that voice acting is decent and i love that i can choose a different language for the audio vs subtitles highly recommended but also very addicting so beware
5,great rpg and i really love that you can connect your account on the phone to your pc or playstation account and pick up where you left off also i love that you can have english voices for the characters just wish that if you use a controller on pc that the game would remember it so i do not have to set it to controller each time i boot it up but that is not a huge issue great game overall best free rpg game i have played
5,i imagine the game is easier to play on pc or console but the mobile version is still very good the movement controls give me some problems but i feel like everything else is optimized well the graphics are nice and i do not experience any lag or framerate drops and the story world and characters are all vibrant and fun and pull me in i may end up switching over to the playstation version but i am really enjoying the android version of the game
5,honestly it is a miracle this game can even exist on phones you can tell this was made by devs who care about the user experience everything about this is high quality the music the graphics the story the controls the user interface the vo the localization with a few exceptions everything comes together to really set a new bar for what games can be on mobile that are not just ports truly astounded keep up the work between this and honkai mihoyo is now definitely on my radar
5,very good game graphics and art style is fantastic and the game play is smooth and good fun to play the game is full of missions and stuff to do so there is never a point where your lost or not sure how to progress the only point i could recommend for further improvement is the multilayercoop lacks any use at the moment it allows you to explore with each other but i would like to see further expansion on this such as maybe missions together
5,love the game overall mostly play the playstation version actively but i play the phone ver just as much one area of concern i have had is artifacts i know it is not much but there should be a locking feature even with the weapons it is very easy to rush into things in this game as it tends to be very sensitive with clicking into things so it is easy to imagine selecting a maxed out item to use as fodder by accident a simple locking feature always does wonders
5,decided to give this game a try after seeing multiple post about how good the game was at the beginning i thought just another anime ish cartoon ish type of game and thought that after playing it for days it would get boring however that was not the case the graphics are impressive the story is really good and there is a lot to do i do not consider it pw because you can get primo easily by completing achievments and exchanging for other usefull equipment items great game
5,the graphics are amazing for a mobile game the fighting mechanic is very strategic in terms of using elements to your opponents weaknesses it is a real open world experience four excellent cutscenes with voice and actual mouth movements five super addictive even when you are not doing quests and just exploring the world six cooperative needs work seven definitely not a pay to win game you can purchase characters with in game currency eight progress saves between all platforms seamlessly
5,all i can say is awesome sauce this game is so much fun i love open world games and this also has a brilliant story too only a couple of things that confuse me once you get your characters it does not show what star level they are and the action buttons are too big i find myself hitting buttons constantly when i am just trying to change my views the virtual joystick needs to be up a little higher too if they could make these things adjustable the layout it would be perfect
5,this game has a lot of basic stuff that works the same as breath of the wild cooking gliding climbing etc but it makes it unique the storyline is engaging and i actually care about it which i cannot say about most other freeplays the art is amazing especially for its open world and sometimes i find myself running around aimlessly because i wanna see whats on top of a cliff and if there is a treasure chest there the only issue is that some of the lines do not match what the voice actor says
5,i was originally annoyed with the millions of ads but after trying the game it is actually pretty fun i am only adventure rank so i have still got alot to go but the exploring i have done really highlights how much effort they put into it to be just like breath of the wild while it is not a rip off breath of the wild there are some cool secrets you just stumble across whether it is treasure or a puzle i do wish there was a quick swap for party members and that is my only issue with the game
5,absolutely fantastic i fell in love with this game and ended up playing pretty much every day i have two play it on pc and the phone genshin impact i say that the pc version is easier to maneuver the story art and music is great i love the characters and even the npcs detail i finish playing this game for hours without interruption because there is too much to do in this game i do hope burning regen faster overall i give this game four five five
5,this game contains a really cool open world that you can explore which lots of neat little extras to go along with it you can glide cook forge weapons and more as for the battle system it is real time and element based paired with an experienced based leveling system and various characters you can choose to use in battle the world also holds culture and lore that you can explore and there is many hidden secrets waiting to be found
5,love this game the story is great the side missions entertaining they have been very receptive about feedback oh and the graphics are top notch love the colors and crisp quality my only issue is the controls in some scenarios like in between rocks or next to a wall characters get stuck or focus on the wrong way and i end up wasting a skill
5,having a fantastic time running this on the pc paired with a playstation controller the visuals are incredible gameplay is awesome and it reminds me of ni no kuni for free to play this is a very enjoyable game as it gives you very close to a full game experience if you do not mind not maxing out characters tried it on mobile definitely not the same experience due to the nature of mobile on screen controls a controller is a must
5,love the game and enjoyed the adventure but i found a bug that happened to me twice both on cp and pc after leaving cooperative the game does not read the characters i was not using during cooperative it is like the system forgot i have other characters and cannot change in game if i swap switch the existing party it goes to the character screen but it is blank and if i go to the character option in the paimon button no character appears and the name is replace with txtcharname
5,great graphics and animations good voice acting awesome waifus and story is decent enough to follow combat is awesome but on mobile it is kinda hard but enjoyable something to fix is like while minimizing you should not be able to disconnect it is annoying when you are looking up a guide or something for a couple minutes or even seconds and you disconnect also being able to adjust your controls would be helpful the configuration now is okay but editing them would be nice
5,have not played too far yet but easily five five so far would get a six five with controller support that is the only thing missing so i have to use a third party app to overlay the button presses which results in some lag issues but that is not the games fault that being said it really is the only thing missing from me giving it a six five score please devs fix controller support
5,the game is very well done in terms of many aspects such as playstyle story telling puzles graphics etc in my opinion however the controls needs a bit tweaking manually tweaking preferably another thing is as i progress later in the game too much resources rely on resin i mean its not bad its just the resin regeneration takes too long thus for me there will not be much chance to resupply myself for the current event nor the next one
5,i usually do not write reviews on mobile games but this game is an exception the graphics are wonderful and the uniqueness crafted into every piece of chunk in the whole map is spectacular to some degree even rivaling some pc games the connection is good enough for other players the game would bug out but that is probably due to device issues or bugs that the game has not fixed yet overall it is one of the most open world games in mobile with more content to come in the future
5,this has been a pleasant surprise but the resin system is too unfriendly open world exploring should be slightly more rewarding this will bring in more players the cooldown of resin does not fit in with this open world besides that the soundtrack graphics and gameplay are all amazing this is coming from someone who makes an effort to complete every game on console pc
5,i love this game but this game still has a lot more room for improvement especially in cooperative there are still many regions left and there are still maps that are too clean for exploring and no this is not your typical mmo rpg it is more of a world of immersion atmosphere and world building instead of your typical auto move auto battle system hate those features takes out the immersion of a game appreciate every nook and cranny of the map it is definitely worth it thanks
5,the graphics are really smooth i have not tried the cooperative mode yet as my adventure rank is still low so i cannot say much at the moment the navigation is easy as you get more familiar with the game some of the tips provided are a bit confusing to understand the items need to be clicked to be picked up instead of being automatically put in the bag
5,the game has blown my expectations clear out of the sky absolutely amazing details from the graphics art and music fun gameplay closest thing to a complaint i have is that the controls are almost too sensitive i plan on getting a controller to see if that helps and the fact that i can play on the pc sounds awesome for when i am home and do not want to waste my phones battery data
5,this game shows how far we have got into mobile gaming the graphics are good and the story is entertaining the voice acting is also excellent while the music is superb the only problem is the network issues the pings are high even in the correct server though this could be temporary and would be fixed soon i liked how you rewarded players who play this game in early release hoping for more
5,beautiful game honestly i am not one to play rpgs at all really and this game is just a joy to play the only real issue i have is that cutscenes lag and freeze a lot like i have to close out the game frequently and reload everything to get it to work ninefive of the time other than that even though i barely just started the game mechanics are easy to understand and figure out and the camera is only slightly wonky but overall pretty dang good only thing that needs a fix is cutscenes
5,everything is amazing i love the graphics the gameplay is run and intuitive and the controls are simple and easy to learn the only problem i have with the game is that i wish it had a auto pickup feature as having to stand near a dropped item for seconds is kind of tedious nonetheless great game this feature is mostly meant for the mobile version as rh pc version is fine as is
5,i have not found it but if it is not there an in game monster manual with all the tips we get would be nice also would like a way to locate my friends in cooperative other than scrolling the whole map searching for their icon besides that great game i am enjoying everything so far the graphics the heroes the challenges and the facr that the whole game does not rely on the energy system
5,quite possibly the best game i have played on my phone i cannot get enough graphic are spectacular gameplay while a little confusing to start is easy to adapt to the controls could be a little better and a button to climb instead of auto climbing and randomly climbing trees in combat would be nice also an option to auto pick up would be nice too gets a little tedious would also like to be able to switch server as the recommended has high latency great game highly reccomended
5,so far one of the most graphically impressive and fun to play game for mobile i have seen and or played love the on screen controls and the ability to actually control your characters movements and attacks sure five gigabyte download is asking a lot from mobile devices storage capabilities but it is well worth it for what you get
5,cannot play well with low to mid end devices it freezes during cutscenes and the game has graphic bugs like their faces disappear or the skins bitmaps extend to the entire screen where you can see nothing although i love the game and would like to see it grow i am giving it a five star review but in exchange would you add optimal settings for weaker phones pretty please
5,to start things off i am instantly met with fantastic and soothing audio while the game finishes installing the open world farming concept is exactly the way i see in anime that i have always yearned for some items have mentioned cooperative but so far this seems to be a single player only game its already at the top of the list of favorites but it would skyrocket if it turns out to be an on line server type game either way still love it
5,i can say playing this game was a bit of a slow start but once progress farther into the story you can do so much more i started playing this around sevenpm by the time i notice the time it was am in the morning my only concern is the button layout is a bit too close together i find myself clicking the jump button more often then the attack button when i am in battle that is why i giving a star for controls if i was able to change the layout then it would have gotten a five star instead
5,this is one of the most beautiful and in depth games i have ever played on a mobile device i love how deep and rich it is i love the open world i love the game play style and combat systems my only suggestion would be the option to adjust the onscreen controls i find myself pushing the wrong buttons or attacking when i just want to adjust my camera
5,a lot of fun basically a free breath of the wild with catch a thrown perfectly able to play most content without spending a dime i do wish costs for pulls were a little lower then i might have even spent a little money myself just at a chance to pull some characters even though it is not nessicary phone controls work but it is better on pc imo as your phone can be a bit slow same with cut scenes they will not load well on the phone but are fine on pc
5,the game is really beautiful and fun and i find it as the best free and beautiful multiplatform game but my only problem is the constant crashes and fps spikes i understand that the game is huge because of the big world and graphics but as a mobile player it is hard to play when i constantly crash but overall the game is perfect keep up the good work
5,beautiful experience so far user interface could use some tweaking though to make it better for me anyways i have a sony experia ii which uses the nine aspect ratio and the controls are not ideal for this setup as my fingers cover more screen than necessary pulling the controls out closer to the edges would greatly improve the experience if possible
5,ten over ten i am new to this type of mobile genre but i love everything that i am experiencing this far thank you for this awesome game the only feedback i would recommend is for there to be less of the user interface that way the full screen can be well displayed while playing without different interfaces being in the way
5,one of the best games i have ever played such attention to detail from the voiceovers to the storyline and the little mini quests spread throughout the map every characters is fascinating to work with and while i have a long way to go in getting hang of all the elemental details and characters switches in battle i am looking forward to figuring it all out what a calming well constructed game so glad i downloaded it
5,unique game on its own since the graphics so high i tend to play on my pc and the way its support cross platform device are the most impressive aspect my only recommendation is to add customizable control settings option if the developer adding this feature it will be perfect to pair with controller and other peripheral for better gaming experience
5,it is great just the type of rpg that i have been trying to find on phones the only problem is that my phone lags a bit so this might work smoothly on a tablet instead it is a little rocky road on phones so i give it two thumbs up as games that could compete with consoles consoles should learn from example of this game instead of being platform driven this game is similar to the perfect rpg that i am thinking or creating si far all i could do is a script format
5,absolutely breathtaking while i prefer to play on pc the mobile version is extremely well done and still very comfortable to play love being able to just pick up from where i was was at any time so so good i prefer playing with voices turned off just because some of the characters are a bit too chatty but the voice acting is still very well done and i enjoy the story so far
5,wow my jaw is scraping along the floor where to start the user interface user experience is amazing the gameplay feels so good and so far it does not look like it is being pay to winy premium currency is earned through gameplay and achievements seriously i am impressed this game is worth a shot amazing visuals audio gameplay i have nothing to complain about so far and that makes me nervous i hope the developers keep up the amazing work
5,so far best mobile game i have played in years only spent about six seven hours in the game so far and i already plan to play for the forseeable future no in your face monetary options the game runs smooth the combat is fun and easy to pick up and i appreciate the party implementation the amount of freedom they give you is amazing from climbing mountains to using a freaking glider and no limit on exploration as to what i have seen so far highly recommend
5,this game is incredibly beautiful the animations are seamless and the music is immersive there are no ads and they do not push for you to pay for anything it is a truly wonderful experience playing this game the only thing i would change is making a way for players to use a bluetooth controller as the touch controls are a little difficult sometimes during intense battles
5,if you came for the gacha look elsewhere i will never appreciate a system with items and units in the same pulls to muddy the chances of getting new characters plus the drop rates are bad to begin with however if you are looking for a well voiced beautifully crafted experience with a world full of nuance and many ideas inspired by an amazing ip then you have come to the right place there is a lot to explore barely even out of the tutorial and there is still so much more to find
5,for a free game and a mobile game it is absolutely amazing i really enjoy the storyline along with the beautiful graphics and soundtrack to go along with i also love the open map and the different actions it has walking climbing jumping swimming gliding as it makes the game feel more free and not constricting you should definitely give this game a try
5,absolutely beautiful game from the beginning this game will show you gorgeous character models environments and you have all the freedom to swim roam and climb as much as your stamina lets you oh the audio it was just beautiful the story as well i wanted to finish prologue first before starting my work but it got me real hooked ah but for some reason cutscenes are very buggy images do not move and transition the audio becomes gritty pretty much the only problem i am having
5,this is a very well done open world rpg graphics are good and the controls were bearable for a mobile game now where is game really shines is on your playstation on a big screen with even better graphics and a controller in you hand for me a much more enjoyable experience the only bad thing i noticed is a low drop rate for five star items all and all i recommend this game
5,this game as far as reasonable complaints go i cannot think of one despite not having controller support the controls are still excellent the graphics compromise little between playstation and mobile and the exploration is at the core of the experience initially i was expecting this to be a bargain bin botw but in truth i enjoy it more a free game with micro transactions keep it up
5,great game do not be fooled or dissuaded by the breath of the wild comparisons it is an open world action rpg alright but it is got its own flair as well the characters elemental system and overworld are so detailed the controls and camera can be improved definitely but they are not game breaking just inconvenient sometimes also some of the voice lines compared to the captions are entirely different from each other which kind of breaks immersion overall definitely worth it
5,overall wonderful game that completely makes the most of each of its platforms i never thought such a high quality and polished game experience could be brought to mobile and on other platforms it is even lore impressive i have gotten lost in exploration and picking exhilarating tactical fights with opponents that should clearly outmatch me my only complaints is that sometimes the movement is a little too sensitive and i cannot pet the dogs in mondstat
5,i really like it no necessary purchases to play nor auto navigation and auto fight lots of storyline that makes senses and additional quests to help you level properly and the graphics are amazing i am very surprised at how much i am enjoying this game i highly recommend this game if you have a lot of free time or just want to try out a new rpg via mobile
5,first immersive rpg that i have ever played on my phone the game mechanics are well designed the graphic is stunning traveling feels smooth it reminds me of kingdoms of amalur however this type of free form traveling can sometime be a bit frustrating on a mobile user interface due to it being hard to control your character to move around overall amazing game especially one that is multi platform with mobile included
5,as of right now this game is blowing my mind and millions of other player minds as well the graphics are on point the mechanics are refreshing and the extensive free roam is the most wonderful thing ever if there were a few things i would like to be seen added it would be the ability to dash after jumping the ability to cross save between playstation and pc or mobile
5,i absolutely love this game i play it on playstation and i am mind blown about this game there is plenty of free character the world looks absolutely gorgeous and is huge it controls really well i do have a few minor gripes with it there is a need for an actual dodge not sprint or block button being stun locked by enemies is incredibly annoying secondly make more than on slot available to refine a weapon give us a map of the collectables locations and finally maybe add pets that follows you
5,for a free to play cross platform mobile game this really goes above and beyond anything else out there in terms of playable content the controls are a bit unresponsive sometimes but for a new release it is such high quality that any complaints i have are dwarfed in the sheer amount to do and play from the engaging dialogue to the unique gameplay there is a lot going for this game i hope it stays around for years to come
5,highly anticipated game that is finally arrived i beta tested the playstation version and was sold immediately playing the mobile version for the first time it is definitely designed well for touch screen phones graphically great sounds and voices are on point and gameplay is fluid responsive only issue so far is the freezing especially during cinematics it is not game breaking but it needs more optimizing for smart phones first day release so issues will arise once that is fixed it will be perfect
5,this game is spectacular i cannot believe that i am playing a game of this level on my phone it is more like a console game seriously you have to try it the open world format is wonderful the english voice acting is great and the animated cut scenes blend seamlessly into gameplay just be sure you have good internet connection or an amazing high speed data plan the only thing missing is gamepad support there is an option to submit feedback in game if we all suggest it they might add gamepad support
5,ok i have decided to continue installing the game as there just are not many good games for android running on an exynos seight the game has stuttering and freezing issues during cinematics and sometimes when attacking the game takes the graphics of zelda breath of the wild and the character story of world of final fantasy and the fighting aesthetic of nier automata it is a fantastic game overall great game to use with a controller i do not recommend it with just a touch screen
5,i have been waiting for this game since it is been announced the developers delivered the gameplay is great the graphics are stunning multiplayer is extremely fun and there is so much to do beyond exploring the summon rates could be better but for a free game it is alright since you can advance regardless of new units i would like to see the mobile version to support a gamepad
5,this game is beautiful the world is huge and always has new things to find the puzles arnt too difficult but do require you to pay attention to complete the sounds are fitting and the music is quite lovely the characters look awesome and the combat is fun there is no auto fighting which i love there are a few glitches though the only one i saw was that sometimes items glitch through the map before you pick them up also it says you can play with friends but does not tell you how
5,this gaming is absolutely amazing i was blown away on how good the sotryline graphic style and all mechanics in the game gamers can easily spend money in this game because everything is reasonable without breaking the bank there are minor issues like others have mentioned control climbing on wall or over railings on the building when not intended and camera view objects blocking the view or sudden change of direction at times just some simple touch ups will make this game perfect
5,this is one of those that feels nothing like a mobile game its open world has little limitations the progress can be a bit short lived at first but the developers want to draw out the story more gameplay is great go off the beaten path and find monsters and hidden chests discover new companions to play as through the story or through the wish system progress in character weapon or artifact level and more i am still finding out more about the game but you can play as much as you want too
5,i never thought i would see a game like this i mainly play it on pc but just having the ability to transfer my save to my phone and play it anywhere feels amazing my phone runs a little slow and loading times take a while but it works the game feels like what breath of the wild would be as a gatcha game but also stands entirely on its own being able to have a vast open world like that on my phone is just mindblowing
5,it is literally ripping off the mechanics of legend of zelda breath of the wild same sparkly items same running insects same stamina same climbing sprinting same encampments and crates and boxes little puzles and challenges and i hate that i love it but the story is actually intriguing the voice actors are good the animation is wonderful it is only been like four days and it is already on the app store in adventure only thing i hate you cannot leave the app for seconds or it closes
5,its got an interesting story with easy to use game mechanics the visuals are beautiful and smooth however it drains battery like crazy and you will want to make sure you have a light and airy phone case to prevent from overheating also do not forget to restart your phone after you install to refresh memory just like with any other app
5,i honestly cannot praise this game enough this takes breath of the wild as a base and adds all the qol you would want weapons do not break upgrade health and stamina together level ups and the freedom to explore plus one hundred percent no strings attached cooperative a games nowadays need to pay attention to this one i wish the mobile versions started with controller support but i can map my own buttons anyways currently mainly playing on pc with my sixty controller but i had to leave a review it is that good
5,my only complaint is that every cut scene the game cannot keep up with itself the audio and video de sync the video stops all together and then the audio crackles exiting the app and re entering it helps briefly other than that the game itself is truely one of it is kind superb graphics easy to learn controls open world adventure amazing quests and side quests it has a story that is honestly a blast to follow i would give this a nine per ten if the cut scenes were not so bad it would one hundred percent ten over ten
5,i am a huge fan of animes especially fantasy ones i love the style the atmosphere and the open world exploration you feel like you have seen everything but the map is so big that you cannot help but keep running around even when your main objective is sidelined by something else and enemies to fight with best part is that the game is not pay to win i recommend the game to anyone who wants to kill some time by some time i mean hours good job guys
5,this is what i have been looking for in a mobile arpg experience for so long i am at adventurer level seven and so far have not run into any auto play nonsense and each quest in the first levels seems to grant a new character the gacha is there but pretty unnecessary in the early game as far as i can tell all of the characters are well thought out and the story is captivating animations and art are amazing and fluid and the voice acting is top notch especially for a free game i love it
5,an absolutely incredible feat of game development this game feels like what breath of the wild could have been if it were better it is a triple a gaming experience on android it is the most polished incredibly well designed game i have ever played on a phone the animations art style gameplay voice acting story and graphics are fantastically well done there are a few minor bugs and you need a fairly high end phone to run it at max settings but those two problems do not harm the game
5,game is gorgeous character designs are really nice and even though i have only played for like an hour i am pretty hooked although i really wish the joystick could be switched to floating i always miss it and end up spinning around trying to get oriented lol edit there is some sort of sound issue inside the cathedral the sound went crazy and was all broken and distorted
5,shockingly polished for a game that is free had someone given me this game to play with no context i would have assumed it costed fifty for what it is with all the comparison to botw a phenomenal game in its own right gi differentiates itself with its charming narrative and streamlined and at times challenging combat its mechanics are inventive in this open world genre and best of all it is cross platform i can end a session on my computer to pick it up on phone where i left off amazing
5,i would say this is the best open world game i have ever played everything is on point the graphics look exactly like the trailers the voice overs for the characters and my favorite feature is that it saves your progress cross platform i switched to my pc and it went back to where i left off it does take a while to download which is understandable because of the graphics the world and individual items but other than that this is my favorite game ever please please please try this out
5,so far this is easily the best all around mobile game i have played it is beautiful to play full voice over easy controls and rewarding to explore so far it appears to be true open world which many other games claim but cannot deliver you control all the action and can take your time the combat is smooth and challenging enough to keep you engaged and the chance at collectibles and hidden chests keeps you wanting to see what is over that next hill bravo
5,not at all what i was expecting pleasantly surprised the graphics are fantastic as is the soundtrack i love the ability to switch between characters as this gives you more variety in play the gliding and free running aspects are second to none there are not any mobile games out there that achieve what genshin has achieved not money hungry game just hours of fun whats not to like
5,really takes inspiration from the legend of zelda breath of the wild and pulls off the concept well with functionality and style i love how open and unrestricted you are for exploration i think it was a good choice to not have an auto move button as the charm of the game was really the exploration and combat i am currently at rank ten and i do not know if we will unlock more but it would be great if we could have more options to bookmark certain areas dungeon challenges
5,extremely fun and engaging story lines the characters and gear look fantastic and the game plays very smoothly making combat and exploring feel fluid the only thing i have a problem with is that i play on playstation and mobile and leaning towards dropping mobile because of no controller support i am on note ten plus playing using a touch screen is very frustrating most of the time this is a shame because playstation will miss out on events and promos that the other version will not like the recent road event
5,the game is overall great with it is graphics gameply and mechanincs although the game requires patience it is still a very fun and exciting game the only issue i have is the transportation the only way for you to explore new territory is through sprinting and teleporting nearby waypoints so i think you should add a mount system for a more convient way of transportation
5,so far overall level ten there is a lot of content for a free game the story is compelling simple and slowly builds at a pace where i can remember it you can explore literally everywhere and there are always things to find the fighting is fun and looks great bosses are actually very hard and can take multiple tries depending on your team and gear very straightforward to upgrade your team and gear the art style is awesome and do not worry paimon gets more tolerable later on
5,the game has been a joy so far i have not encountered any bugs or issues with the gatcha system having registered before release was able to obtain a nice array of characters graphics are beautiful combat is excellent the storyline developing nicely if somewhat aimed at a younger marker as always it will be end game where issues with grind or pay to win start emerging it is too early to predict how this will go none should be adverse to paying for a good game though
5,beyond five stars i have few very minor personal issues though it may be a bit difficult to pick up items when running it would be cool if there was an auto pickup or something when doing idle animations your feet no longer align with the terrain underneath leaving the game or even turning phone power for a little bit makes you immediately disconnect thus making you need to start any dungeon or temple all over
5,it is an sick game with a huge open world beautiful graphics and amazing story line and voice acting even though its a big game it is worth the space be prepared though for a couple game glitches to pop report them to make the game more enjoyable for everyone however there is this one serious bug that has been ruining my experience audio glitch where all sounds go static after a while of just playing the game hope it gets fixed soon so i can enjoy the voice acting and music to the fullest
5,i am very pleased with my experience thus far high points for me the gameplay is fun in particular exploring and combat the aesthetic is beautiful the story premise is promising minor low points for me there are occasionally moments of lag but i am not sure if it is the games fault the joystick control is fixed in place unlike other games where the joystick centers on where my thumb or finger initially touches the screen it is not bad but takes getting used to
5,beautiful smooth game play immersive captivating with a good momentum it can be challenging but not overpowering you collect chatactures and weapons through a points system so always chance for change and varity cut scenes were a little shaky at first but that seems to be quickly fixed does take a beating on your phone mines been getting pretty hotz but honestly it is worth it i will update when i have gotten more familiar with it but for now it seems like a keeper
5,game looks and plays beautifully but my audio stops working after hour of game play i have repeatedly re installed the game to temporarily fix the issue but the audio goes mute after hour again i am using a flagship device please revert as i need this fixed i have made in game purchases i want the complete experience
5,weirdly well made the team that made this definitely put alot of work into it full voice acting smooth animation greatly detailed graphics i have it on the highest settings surprisingly well designed controls and animated cut scenes the story also is not terrible altogether a very well made game although you will need to have a powerful phone to run this on high settings there is alot of mention in the comments that it lags badly
5,i have had a really good experience playing the game and have been trying to hold in my excitement since the beginning of the year the gameplay is really smooth and i enjoy using the unique movesets on each character i also love gacha as well as open world games so putting together was a great idea gacha is optional one problem is that every time i leave the app and come back it says reconnecting but i can understand why and it does not take that long so it is not too much of a problem
5,excellent game i enjoy that it is not one of those on rails rpgs that does all the walking and flight for you it encourages you to explore the world and it is jammed packed full of treasure and mobs but spaced enough to let you enjoy the scenery so far i have not seen anything in it being pay to win which is definitely good fights are challenging and knowing how elements affect other elements makes battles all the more strategic it is also quite beautiful and filled with lots of lore
5,single player rpg games usually do not even get my attention but this one my goodness it is a good exception i know we can play it with friends but i have yet to try it the graphics are beautiful very good controls lots of things to do huge map few loading screen overall i am loving it downside is that sometimes the game has heavy lag i hope it gets fixed soon
5,right off the bat the game looks like a high end indie game made for pc which had me a little worried at first since my experience with third person mobile games are not the best this game beats all of them and then some it runs so smoothly on my relatively cheap android phone no internet problems here though connectivity does seem to be a problem for others i have yet to experience it storywise it is fine the voiceacting is superb though and makes up for what the story lacks
5,it absolutely blows my mind that a game with this level of quality is free i have already gotten hours of fun gameplay and did not need to spend a dime the game incentivizes you to explore and mess around but it does not restrict you with a recharge system or anything like that the combat is fast paced and the way you can form and plan out team compositions is unique and innovative i think this game is going to set the bar for free games down the road
5,voice acting could be better a little more focus on the main plot could have been great too but this game is about as close to zelda botw as you can get on a phone it is fantastic controls feel great weapon designs are great the art is amazing the mechanics are awesome the sound design and osts are great too there is little to not like in the game
5,the game is heavily optimised to run even on slower devices i am rather thankful to the development team for doing so it allows more players to enjoy the game on lower end devices and remain smooth and operational as for the game itself the story the graphics the mechanics are all great and beautiful totally worth the wait
5,genshin impact was a surprise it is an openworld adventure game that was beyond what i have expected people say that this game is a direct rip off of the legend of zelda breath of the wild but id say otherwise the graphics are console level and the story is top quality however the controls are a little annoying and the option to move and customise the controls would greatly help anyways this game is spectacular and one of the best in years thank you for reading and thank you mihoyo
5,amazing its a little similar to breathe of the wild in that it is open world and you do not necessarily need to follow the story to some extent which i think is awesome as well as paragliding by the way but you can use different wings ps i am at level ten adventure and i am hoping on being able to ride something to get around faster maybe but anyway ten over ten
5,the game and gameplay is really cool the game is really responsive and lag free the only problem i found is that some open world noises are not properly mastered and they give out and awful sound other than that good job edit i tried out the game on pc and it works flawlessly the only minor thing i noticed and would be happy to see is to allow key binding changes on the pc version some of the controls are not user friendly also the phone i use to play is samsung galaxy ten
5,i was eagerly waiting for this game and when it finally came out i was so stunned to see that they made it open world with a great story the controls story gameplay graphics and the mechanics are all great the only thing that breaks immersion is how the camera suddenly faces down when we fall and stays at that angle overall mechanics of fighting is just awesome this is truly a paradise for gamers
5,my journey so far in the game has been amazing graphics and controls are great system is easy to understand for now my only complaints is that the game suddenly stops at random times and kicks me out to the phones home screen i do not know if its maybe related to the log in options or something else so i will be glad if this can be fixed i will update this peace of text if problems are still there edit never mind it was just the server getting overloaded with new players downloading
5,its a great game beautiful graphics and is filled with a lot of character this game has obviously been made with love so five stars my only problem though is the loading process it takes forever i played the game for several hours and finally went off to eat and rehydrate but when i tried coming back it just took forever to load again loading things it already loaded
5,the game is great however when it was connected with my samsung ear buds live its sound effects have some litte noises but i did not have this issue when i was playing other games like two k twenty mobile or something maybe it is the problem of incompatibility and i hope there will be some improvement of the issue for the better game experience
5,gorgeous fun and thrilling i enjoyed every aspect of the game from the graphics the incredible soundtrack to the combat system genshin impact ticks all the right boxes i am amazed by the world it presents along with its intriguing lore a diverse group of playable characters makes things more interesting especially during battles when team composition plays an important role all in all an astonishing adventure that will take your breath away if your device can run it get it
5,knowing that its released the gameplay is amazing nice graphics easy controls open world etc the only downfalls that i have encountered playing is the cutscenes it freezes up the other is phone overheating when it heats up you lose progress but other than those the game is amazing great to play keep up the work d
5,controls are a bit wonky on mobile i have to reach my left thumb quite a bit to shift to a faster walk i would love a control scheme change option in the setting to place buttons where you are most comfortable or scale things to size also i think sometimes my bluetooth earbuds do something to the game to make the audio a bit staticy but it could just be me amazing graphics and a lovely story give it a try it may be your new favorite adventure game
5,great game so far just a few things that can be improved on the graphics and story are amazing there are some things that can be improved on like some quality of life changes and also the cutscene the cutscene frezes during a few transitions and in the midlle for a few seconds and the voices also glitch a bit should be worth looking into other than that it is a great game
5,absolutely beautiful game from the beginning this game will show you gorgeous character models environments and you have all the freedom to swim roam and climb as much as your stamina lets you the combat is pretty fun so far being a ranged class for example it is really smooth having the option to break into a sprint to get some space and have the choice to really aim your shots with a gyro aiming option to do some damage i genuinely cannot get over how pretty this mobile game is
5,first it is cross platformed it has a great way in letting people play with eachother because of the adaptability of it being able to support other devices the graphics are really great and so was the gameplay i like the storyline and voice acting it has many different playstyles you can do not just hunting down enemies so people can choose what they want to do lastly i really like how it is open world even though the mob difficulty spikes but just roaming around and exploring is great
5,so far i am enjoying this game i love the story line you get to change characters which is awesome we get an option to change voice language amazing and text language so you can separate two languages character design is cute one thing is inconvenient is that we do not get to autorun to a quest location lastly i know they have monthly pass but it would be great if they have a lifetime pass that i could buy just to show support for the game as well as getting benefit in doing so
5,it is incredible it has a lot of features found in the legend of zelda breath of the wild so it is quite enjoyable you can explore the world come across monsters pick up things like fruit that you find hunt animals etc the graphics are breathtaking as well and unlike a lot of games similar to this the dialogue is easy to understand and is not broken english its obvious a ton of effort was put into this game but it is not a game you should be getting if you have a slow device
