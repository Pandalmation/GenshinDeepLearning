Be prepared though for a couple game glitches to pop, report them to make the game more enjoyable for everyone! However there is this one serious bug that has been ruining my experience. Audio glitch where all sounds go static after a while of just playing the game. Hope it gets fixed soon so I can enjoy the voice acting and music to the fullest",5,2020-09-30 09:15:11,1.0.0_1112729_1135452

The world quests, and story quests are also good,fun, detailed, and it makes so much sense and sometimes confusing which makes me make some of my own theories.only problemo is the Fandom/community. Its kind of getting toxic. I hope hoyo take care of that next.",3,2023-11-12 16:14:49,

I hate the fact that I have to pull 10 wishes in order to get ONLY 1 new character or 2-3 if you are SUPER SUPER LUCKY. But it really FRUSTRATES me out as there are many people that cannot PAY to get as much primogems. As a beginner,it's quite hard to earn primogems so it is very hard for me to actually get a new character. The quests don't usually give primogems also.",4,2023-10-16 22:05:29,
b5ba99b0-a509-4ab7-977a-e0f6c31c6768,This is a very well done open world RPG. Graphics are good and the controls were bearable for a mobile game. Now where is game really shines is on your PS4. On a big screen with even better graphics and a controller in you hand. For me a much more enjoyable experience. The only bad thing I noticed is a low drop rate for five star items. All and all I recommend this game.,5,2020-10-05 05:21:35,1.0.0_1112729_1135452

I would also suggest it to work on making it more smoother for 4gb phone, since it's a bit choppy, as I said.",4,2020-10-15 09:30:21,1.0.0_1112729_1135452
7cfdae9f-ce33-4ff1-bb69-8cb4799eabd9,"To be honest, a game like this shouldn't even require you to use Wi-Fi. Since it's more like solo game like legend of zelda and co-op just gives you the option whether or not you want to play with your friends or other players. Also, the game needs some optimization, since it doesn't really run smoothly even at low graphic settings with mid-range phones. So it's more likely more compatible and smooth to play with a highspec or gaming phone. Still, I love the game! Superb for mihoyo :^)",5,2020-11-15 06:08:40,

Since this game has amazing graphics it can be hard for your phone to show everything smoothly. I think you should play it in a phone with a lot if storage. I also like the characters! And the system where you can go everywhere! To even think a masterpiece like this is free still surprise me! I really recommend this game!,5,2021-02-13 23:48:34,1.0.0_1112729_1135452

I know it's not much, but there should be a locking feature (even with the weapons). It's very easy to rush into things in this game, as it tends to be very sensitive with clicking into things, so it is easy to imagine selecting a maxed out item to use as fodder by accident.

After maybe a week of playing, you completely run out of things to do in the world and the only real repeatable content is locked behind the ""resin"" system, which is basically just ""stamina"" from other mobile games. You only get 120 max resin, and everything costs between 20-60 resin per run. The game quickly turns into one where you log on, spend your resin in 10-15 minutes, then log out.

The story has got us anticipating more. Although it is captivating, it isn't really new player friendly. The new characters and weapons require items that new players can't have access to.

The characters are generally well thought out and fun to discover. Where things get hard is once you actually play the game: the controls are absolutely horrible and controller support is nowhere in sight (iOS has had this for nearly a year now but some of the workarounds people have come up with on Android have led to users being banned leaving you to contend with very underwhelming touchscreen controls). You will also find yourself fighting the engine much more than the enemies, there are a number of ways the game becomes anti-immersive, from the constant zooming-in depending on your combat actions (there should simply be a way to turn off auto zoom off but this illudes the devs completely) to enemies walking off a preset area mid-fight where they will walk back to their spawn point and regen 100% HP and have you start the fight over (something to drive you insane when fighting new and more powerfull foes).

There should be a hardware check or some form of benchmark before letting you decide if you want to perform the 6GB download or not. The intro could barely play freezing most of the time and the game looks blurry. Otherwise from what I've managed to play it looks promising.

Another thing is as I progress later in the game, too much resources rely on resin.

e4de10e3-e0ba-4dab-95df-873b0d0cd900,Everything seems good but I still have issues with using the bow in mobile. Sometimes the sensitivity when aiming is not what it seems. An example is when I try to aim at something but moving the screen around to adjust the aim at the enemy feels very heavy sometimes. It feels like it's buggy/laggy so I can't aim properly. My ping is usually green and sometimes yellow. I know about the new features added in the settings for bows to help in aiming but it still doesn't help with my problem.,4,2021-05-01 16:45:08,1.5.0_2574575_2578841

In a boss battle area where the bosses will sometimes even do it even in an enclosed area. So you can be 10 to 15 minutes in use a bunch of healing stuff. And they just get full health.

They did fix the gameplay from a year ago to being more interractive and responsive, but from materials grind to level up boost grind, it's too tiring to actually get into.

The game may lag sometimes but that's possibly cause there isn't a server that's near where I live and it's honestly not that bad. There's a lot of loading at the start so you need to be patient but other than that and cut scenes the game is almost load screen free despite the large open world experience it provides.

I did experience some problems, like storage issue and performance/battery issue, but as long as you have decent phone, you'll play it just fine.

It used to run smoothly on my redmi note 9s but now, even at lowest settings, the game still lags a lot and switching between characters really has delays which is a nightmare especially when facing bosses at crucial times.

Would say that to improve, when leveling characters would be great to increase a certain skill or attribute on each level, would make for a much more unique experianced. Same with weapons and artifacts, giving an option to increase perks on level up would be great. All in all though probably best mobile game I've played. This would easily sell on console!

I've also played Honkai Impact but I can say that they are nothing alike (this is good thing). Everything in this game is true to form for mIHoYo...top line production for everything--animation, music, art, voiceover, attention to detail some of the best. The world is truly OPEN and explorable. I am a very old school RPG player and have logged years into games such as Final Fantasy XI, XIV and many others (too many to mention) and I can honestly say that this feels very fresh and exciting even to me. The game presents encounters and events in like a D&D session in that they feel unexpected and thrilling. Players that are willing to explore the world will be rewarded. Although there is basic quest waypoints, the game does not autopath you. There's a small golden sparkle path and a basic direction icon. One of the most amazing things is how you can interact with the world. You are able to chop down small trees, climb larger ones (helpful to reach fruit that's up high) climb mountains to reach higher areas, even climb over walls in the towns. You can harvest and hunt in this game (and also cook the ingredients), and I would not be surprised if fishing is in there because there are fish in the waters, but they are very hard to catch by hand. I could go on and on. Way surpassed my already high expectations. The gameplay itself seems pretty basic action RPG style (3 basic moves, with charge ups) but with time perhaps this will become more fleshed out.

My only issue, and the reason why this is a 4 star rating, is that on mobile, when I go to collect an artifact or item, it takes forever for the item to pop up. That and when ganyu freezes water the water melts right away. I want to run by a flower and collect it without slowing down for seconds at a time. If the pop up to collect the item in front of me was faster id give 5 stars. My WiFi is excellent and phone has high ram. Graphics set to low.",4,2021-02-07 12:58:40,1.3.0_1825294_1872772

Enhancing gear just feels like an annoying obstacle that you have to get through just so you can keep progressing. And, perhaps the most irritating thing is how clunky the transitions from activity such as swimming, climbing, etc. are to going back to walking/combat, especially during timed challenges.

The gacha system is very unfair for free to play players/low spending players . A guaranteed 5 star item for 90 pulls is way too much considering that the items are random and could be a duplicate item and you can only farm around 3000 primogems a month which will only give less than 20 pulls. 2.

They have a lot of security and balance issues at the moment which is making many of the player base weary of playing the game, and many unwilling to spend. And communication on these issues have been poor or poorly received. Game currently has a lot of progression strain on their stamina system(Resin). Specifically Mora(gold) and hero XP. Getting a new hero takes 2+ weeks of grinding to get them at a playable place. Then you need to spend even longer farming gear. This leaves you at a place of always needing to farm for the future. BUT the game is still great at it's base. You can do everything but their ""end game"" (3 tower stages that reset bi-monthly). You can do those stages, but will require a lot of careful investment. It is a solid 30-40 hours of content. More if you don't rush through it. Until the security issues are fixed, I would think before spending money. Otherwise give it a shot for a while. But keep tabs on the communities of the game. Reddit is a good one, but can be an echo chamber at times. Until at the least the security issues are fixed, I cannot justify more than 3 stars.

But maybe the Product Manager or even the Dev is the one who ruin it all. - Breaking the equality of re-run character(maybe just for some new player). Instead of re-run it equally for everyone. - In 2.0-2.1. There are the great unequal distribution between new female and male characters. - In 2.0-2.1. There are rushing new characters, that cause the new unfinished characters, but they still release them. Actually, if they planed them to take turn with re-run character, they would have more time to finalize them. - We can say good bye to Hydro-character. There are too few of them, while there are too many Pyro/Electro/Cryo-character. And Hydro-characters are quite underpowered. Which I mention above, you can say there is no balance in this game(in almost all aspect) at all. Moreover, something that need to be fixed, but it can not be fixed due to a gacha rule.

I think maybe in the future try to give more fragile resins, hero wits(esp in story quests), and also why not add a bit more commissions in the future?It may be unfair(somehow) but it's my personal opinion.

If you hope for a game to grind out without paying - not your option at all. You can't get far without paying money because chances of getting the good chars are really low.

Then I was anticipating an anniversary event to boost me up a bit and slowly started to see a lot of people talking about event being really mediocre. And turns out it was. Not only I was baffled by amount of free wish they give out, amount of effort they put into anniversary event was just mind boggling. In a worst way possible. I think it would've been better if they just didn't give out anything for free for the anniversary event. And just put deep discounts on some of the stuff they offer would've been much better. I cannot give anything lower than 2 star because I did actually enjoy the game and missing out on anniversary freebee won't probably make myself stop playing.

It was shaping up to be a great game with future updates. I was very excited at the time. However ""updates"" only occur once every two months and the ""updates"" are usually the addition of minigames that will take up about a few hours with no substantial content to them; just a temporary distraction. It has been almost a year until we actually got a substantial update with a whole new region, which has been great but I'm finding it very hard to believe it would take a whole year to create this. When the real updates do come, it is great but the pace of update releases have been awful. Even now, with the most recent survey it doesn't seem like the company cares anymore, previous surveys would gather more information if you didn't like something, an opportunity for constructive feedback in some way. The most recent survey doesn't even bother, don't like something? Okay cool and the survey moves on to the next question. It started off as an exciting open world game, with amazing potential, but it has devolved over time. Endgame is doing your daily chores then logging off, waiting for the next minigame drop.

The number of repetitive 3 star weapons is also very high with a limited number of options. There is a higher chance of getting 100 pieces of each 3-star weapons than completing a set of 4-star weapons (1 each). Bad!,2,2021-10-16 10:59:19,2.2.0_4340077_4464168
