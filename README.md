# GenshinNetwork
Final Project repository for Artificial Intelligence and Research Methodology 

# About
ok so this repo contains a LOT of experiments lol.
- BERTGenshin: NPL Using BERT for Genshin Impact Review Sentiment Analysis
- GenshinReview: preprocessing collection of reviews experiment
- AIFINAL and genshinNetwork: GNN to classify character importance in their network
# Data folder
this consists of multiple datasets:
- GenshinReview.csv (for BERTGenshin)
- edge_list (for AIFINAL and genshinNetwork)
- node_list (for AIFINAL and genshinNetwork)
- node_list2 (for AIFINAL and genshinNetwork)
- output.csv (data to conduct preprocessing in GenshinReview.ipynb)

# Task Specification
Our task is to use a pre-trained BERT model to conduct Sentiment Analysis of Genshin Impact Game reviews from the Google Play Store. The goal is for the model to be able to accurately predict the user sentiment towards the game which can be either negative, neutral or positive. The final product will be to provide a comprehensive record for developers, current users, and potential users of the Genshin Impact application. The input to the model will be Genshin Impact Game Reviews stored in csv format.

# Model Evaluation
